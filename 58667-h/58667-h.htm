</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><i>“HANG up my old whip over the fireplace,”
said Harry Littler, of the Southampton
“Telegraph,” when the London and Southampton
Railway was opened, in 1833,—“I shan’t want it
never no more”: and he fell ill, turned his face to
the wall, and died.</i></p>

<p><i>The end of the coaching age was a tragedy for
the coachmen; and even to many others, whose
careers and livelihood were not bound up with the
old order of things, it was a bitter uprooting of
established customs. Many travellers were never
reconciled to railways, and in imagination dwelt
fondly in the old days of the road for the rest of
their lives; while many more never ceased to recount
stories of the peculiar glory and exhilaration
of old-time travel, forgetting the miseries and inconveniences
that formed part of it. But although
reminiscent oldsters have talked much about those
vanished times, they have rarely attempted a consecutive
story of them. Such an attempt is that
essayed in these pages, confined within the compass
of two volumes, not because material for a third
was lacking, but simply for sake of expediency. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
is shown in the body of this book, and may be noted
again in this place, that the task of writing anything
in the nature of a History of Coaching is
rendered exceeding difficult by reason of the disappearance
of most of the documentary evidence on
which it should be based; but I have been fortunate
enough to secure the aid of Mr. Joseph Baxendale
in respect of the history of Pickford &amp; Co., of
Mr. William Chaplin, grandson of the great
coach-proprietor, and of Mr. Benjamin Worthy
Horne, grandson of Chaplin’s partner, for information
concerning their respective families.
Colonel Edmund Palmer, also, communicated
interesting notes on his grandfather, John Palmer,
the founder of the mail-coach system. To my
courteous friend, Mr. W. H. Duignan, of
Walsall, whose own recollections of coaching, and
whose collections of coaching prints and notes I
have largely used, this acknowledgment is due.
Mr. J. B. Muir, of 35, Wardour Street, my
obliging friend of years past, has granted extensive
use of his collection of sporting pictures, and
Messrs. Arthur Ackermann &amp; Son, of 191, Regent
Street, have lent prints and pictures from their
establishment.</i></p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">The</span> lines quoted above are not remarkably good
as poetry. Nay, it is possible to go farther, and to
say that they are exceptionally bad—the product
of one of those corn-box poets who were accustomed
to speak of steam as a “demon foul”; but
if his lines are bad verse, the central idea is good.
That man who first essayed to drive four-in-hand
must indeed have been more than usually
courageous.</p>

<p>To form anything at all like an adequate idea
of the Coaching Age, it is first necessary to
discover how people travelled before that age
dawned. As a picture is made by contrasted
light and shade, so is the story of the coaching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
period only to be properly set forth by first
narrating how journeys were made from place to
place before the continuous history of wheeled
traffic begins. That history, measured by mere
count of years, is not a long one. It cannot, in
its remotest origin, go back beyond the first
appearance of the stage-waggon, about 1590, when
the peasantry of this kingdom began to obtain an
occasional lift on the roads, and sat among the
goods which it was the first business of those
waggons to carry. The peasant, then, was the
first coach-passenger, for while he was carried
thus, everyone else, in all the estates of the
realm, from King and Queen down to the middle
classes, rode horseback, and it was not until 1657
and the establishment of the Chester Stage that
the Coaching Age opened for the public in
general.</p>

<p>If, then, we please to pronounce for that event
as the true beginning, and allow 1848, the year
when one of the last coaches, the Bedford “Times,”
was withdrawn from the London and Bedford
road in consequence of the opening of the
Bletchley and Bedford branch railway, to be the
end, we have the beginning, the growth and
perfection of the old coaching era, and its final
extinction, all comprised within a period of a
hundred and ninety-one years.</p>

<p>Wheeled conveyances are generally said by the
usual books of reference to take their origin in
this country with the introduction of Queen
Mary’s Coronation carriage in 1553; but, so far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
from that being correct, mention of carriages is
often found in authorities of a period earlier by
almost two centuries. Thus, in her will of September
25th, 1355, Elizabeth de Burgh, Lady Clare,
bequeathed her “great carriage, with the covertures,
carpets, and cushions,” to her eldest daughter;
and carriage-builders at the close of Edward III.’s
reign charged £100 and £1000 for their wares.
Carts were not unknown to the peasantry;
Froissart tells us that the English returned from
Scotland in 1360 in “charettes,” a kind of carriage
whose make he does not specify; and ladies are
discovered in 1380 travelling with the baggage
in “whirlicotes,” which were cots or beds on
wheels, or a species of wheeled litter. We have,
by favour of one of the old chroniclers, a fugitive
picture of Richard II., at the age of seventeen,
travelling in one of these whirlicotes, accompanying
his mother, who was ill.</p>

<p>But such instances do not prove more than
occasional use, and it certainly appears that when
Queen Mary rode from the Tower of London to
Westminster on her Coronation Day, September
20th, 1553, in her State coach, she thereby revived
the use of carriages, which, for some reason or
another, had fallen into disuse since those early
days. Her coachmaker, by a grant made on
May 29th in the first year of her reign, was one
Anthony Silver.</p>

<p>We may seek the cause of wheeled conveyances
going out of use in the two centuries before this
date in the steady and continuous decay of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
roads consequent upon the troubled state of
the kingdom in that intervening space. Rebellions,
pestilences, foreign wars, and domestic
strife had marked that epoch. The Wars of the
Roses themselves lasted thirty years, and in all
that while the social condition of the people had
not merely stood still, but degenerated. Towns
and districts were half depopulated, and the
ancient highways fell into disuse. It is significant
that the first General Highway Act, a
measure passed in 1555, was practically coincident
with the reintroduction of carriages.</p>

<p>Queen Mary’s Coronation carriage—or, as it
was called in the language of that time, “coach”—was
drawn by six horses, less for reasons of
display than of sheer necessity, for, with a less
numerous and powerful team, it would probably
have been stuck fast in the infamously bad roads
that then set a gulf of mud between the twin
cities of London in the east and Westminster in
the west. Only three other carriages followed
her Majesty on that historic occasion, and the
ladies who attended rode horseback.</p>

<p>Two years after this new departure mention is
found of a “coach”—still, of course, a carriage—made
for the Earl of Rutland by one Walter
Rippon, who in the same year appears to have
built a new one for the Queen.</p>

<p>The next patron of carriages seems to have
been Sir Thomas Hoby, sometime Her Britannic
Majesty’s Ambassador to the French Court: that
Sir Thomas who lies beside his brother, Sir Philip,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
in their magnificent tomb in the little Berkshire
village church of Bisham, beside the Thames.
He owned a carriage in 1566.</p>

<p>The progressive age of Elizabeth now opens.
In 1564, six years after her accession, she was using
a carriage brought over from Holland by a certain
William Boonen, himself a Hollander. Boonen,
indeed, became her Majesty’s coachman, but his
services cannot often have been required, for, if
we are to believe Elizabeth’s own words to the
French Ambassador in 1568, driving in these early
carriages, innocent of springs, must have been as
uncomfortable as a journey in a modern builder’s
cart or an ammunition-waggon would be. When
his Excellency waited upon her, she was still
suffering “aching pains, from being knocked
about in a coach driven too fast a few days
before.”</p>

<p>Little wonder, then, that the great Queen used
her coach only when occasions of State demanded.
She journeyed to her palace at Greenwich by
water, between Greenwich and her other palace
of Eltham on horseback, and to Nonsuch and
Hampton Court and on her many country progresses
in like manner, resorting only to wheels
with advancing years. How bad were even the
roads especially repaired for her coming may
be judged from a contemporary description of
her journey along that “new highway” whose
“perfect evenness” is the theme of the writer.
“Her Majesty left the coach only once, while
the hinds and the folk of a base sort lifted it on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
with their poles.” Majesty must have been sore
put to it to look majestic on such occasions, and in
the bad condition of all roads at that time we find
a new significance in the courtliness of Sir Walter
Raleigh, who at Greenwich threw his velvet cloak
upon the ground for Elizabeth to walk over.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was an accomplished horsewoman,
and it is not surprising, under these circumstances,
that she made full use of the accomplishment,
continuing on all possible public occasions
to appear in this manner. On longer journeys
she rode on a pillion behind a mounted chamberlain,
holding on to him by his waistbelt just as
ladies continued to do for centuries yet to come.
The curious in these things may find interest in
the fact that the modern groom’s leathern waistbelt,
which now serves no practical function, is
merely a strange survival of that old necessity of
feminine travel. The commonly-received opinion
that Elizabeth objected to carriages from the
supposed “effeminacy” of using them receives a
severe shock from her carriage experiences, which
make it quite obvious that travelling in the
earliest of them was only to be indulged in by
persons of the strongest frame and in the rudest
health. She who mounted on her palfrey before
her troops at Tilbury, when the Armada threatened,
could justly claim that though but a woman she
had the spirit of a King—aye, and a King of
England—quailed before the rigours of a carriage-drive.</p>

<p>In 1579 the Earl of Arundel imported one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
these new and strange machines from Germany.
How novel and strange they were may be gathered
from the particular mention thus accorded them
in the annals of the time. When we consider
how bad was the condition even of the streets of
London, it will be abundantly evident that a
desire for display rather than comfort brought
about the increasing use of carriages that marked
the closing years of Elizabeth’s reign. By 1601
they had become so comparatively numerous that
it was sought to obtain an Act restraining their
excessive use and forbidding men riding in them.
This projected ordinance especially set forth the
enervating nature of riding in carriages; but
it would seem that the real objection was the
growing magnificence displayed in this way by
the wealthy, tending to overshadow the public
appearances of Royalty itself. Whatever the real
reason of this disabling measure, it was rejected
on the second reading and never became law,
and four years later both hackney and private
carriages were in common use in London. Carters
and waggoners hated them with a bitter hatred,
called them “hell-carts,” and heaped abuse upon
all who used them. Both their primitive construction
and the fearful condition of the roads
rendered their use impossible in the country.
Teams of fewer than six horses were rarely seen
drawing coaches in what were then regarded as
London suburbs, districts long since included in
Central London; and perhaps even the haughty
and arrogant Duke of Buckingham, favourite of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
James I. and Charles, was misjudged when, in
1619, the people, seeing his carriage drawn by
that number, “wondered at it as a novelty, and
imputed it to him as a mastering pride.” Had he
employed fewer horses he certainly would have
been obliged to get out and walk, or to have again
resorted to the use of the sedan-chair, in which,
before he had set up a carriage, he was used to be
carried, greatly to the indignation of the populace,
to whom sedan-chairs were at that time novelties.
“The clamour and the noise of it was so
extravagant,” we are told, “that the people would
rail upon him in the streets, loathing that men
should be brought to as servile a condition as
horses.” Yet no one ever thought of denouncing
Buckingham or any other of the magnificos when
they lolled in easy seats under the silken hangings
of their state barges and were rowed by the labour
of a dozen lusty oarsmen on the Thames. The
work was as servile as the actual carrying of a
passenger, but the innate conservatism of mankind
could not at first perceive this. On the whole,
Buckingham therefore has our sympathy. The most
innocent doings of a favourite with Royalty are
capable of being twisted into haughty and
malignant acts, and had it not been for Buckingham’s
position at Court his displays would not
have brought him the hatred of the people and
the rivalry of his own order which they certainly
did arouse. The Earl of Northumberland was one
of those who were thus goaded into the rivalry
of display. Hearing that the favourite had six<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
horses to his carriage, he thought that he might
very well have eight, “and so rode,” we are told,
“from London to Bath, to the vulgar talk and
admiration.”</p>

<p>The first public carriages, according to a statement
made to Taylor, the “water poet,” by Old
Parr, the centenarian, were the “hackney-coaches,”
established in London in 1605. “Since then,”
says Taylor, writing on the subject at different
times between 1623 and 1635, “coaches have
increased with a mischief, and have ruined the
trade of the watermen by hackney-coaches, and
now multiply more than ever.” The “watermen”
were, of course, those who plied with their boats
and barges for hire upon the Thames, chiefly
between London and Westminster, the river being
then, and for long after, the principal highway for
traffic in the metropolis. So greatly, indeed, was
the river traffic for the time affected, that the
sprack-witted Taylor relinquished his trade of
waterman and embarked upon the more promising
career of pamphleteering.</p>

<p>“Thirty years ago,” he says, in one of these outbursts,
“The World runnes on Wheeles,” “coaches
were <span class="locked">few”:—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then upstart helcart coaches were to seeke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man could scarce see twenty in a weeke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now I thinke a man may daily see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than the whirries on the Thames can be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Carroches, coaches, jades and Flanders mares<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doe rob us of our shares, our wares, our fares;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the ground we stand and knock our heeles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilest all our profit runs away on wheeles.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
“This,” we find him saying, on another occasion,
“is the rattling, rowling, rumbling age, and the
world runnes on wheeles. The hackney-men, who
were wont to have furnished travellers in all
places with fitting and serviceable horses for any
journey, are (by the multitude of coaches) undone
by the dozens.”</p>

<p>The bitter cry of Taylor and the Thames
watermen may or may not have been hearkened
to, but certainly hackney-coaches were prohibited
in 1635. This, however, was probably due rather to
Royal whim or prejudice than to any consideration
for a decaying trade.</p>

<p>It was an arbitrary age, and it only needed a
Star Chamber order for public carriages, considered
by the Court to be a nuisance, to be suppressed.
The reasons advanced read curiously at this time:
“His Majesty, perceiving that of late the great
numbers of hackney-coaches were grown a great
disturbance to the King, Queen, and nobility
through the streets of the said city, so as the
common passage was made dangerous and the
rates and prices of hay and provender and other
provisions of the stable thereby made exceeding
dear, hath thought fit, with the advice of his
Privy Council, to publish his Royal pleasure, for
reformation therein.” His Majesty therefore
commanded that no hackney-coaches should be
used in London unless they were engaged to
travel at least three miles out of town, and
owners of such coaches were to keep sufficient
able horses and geldings, fit for his Majesty’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
service, “whensoever his occasion shall require
them.”</p>

<p>This despotic measure was amended in 1637,
when fifty hackney-coachmen for London were
licensed, to keep not more than twelve horses each.
This meant either that three hundred or a hundred
and fifty public carriages then came into use,
according to whether two or four horses were
harnessed. “And so,” says Taylor, “there grew
up the trade of coach-building in England.”</p>

<p>These early carriages, whether hackney or
private, were not only without springs, but were
innocent of windows. In their place were shutters
or leather curtains. The first “glass coach”
mentioned is that made for the Duke of York in
1661. Pepys at this period becomes our principal
authority on this subject. On May 1st, 1665,
he is found witnessing experiments with newly-designed
carriages with springs, and again on
September 5th, finding them go not quite so easy
as their inventor claimed for them. Yet, since
private carriages were clearly becoming the
fashion, Mr. Secretary-to-the-Admiralty Pepys
must needs have one; and accordingly, on
December 2nd, 1668, he takes his first ride:
“Abroad with my wife, the first time that I
ever rode in my own coach.”</p>

  <div class="caption smaller">ARMS OF THE WORSHIPFUL COMPANY OF COACH AND
HARNESS MAKERS.</div></div>

<p>Pepys always delighted in being in the fashion.
He would not be in advance of it, and not, if he
could help it, behind. The fact, then, of his
setting up a carriage of his own is sufficient to
show how largely the moneyed classes had begun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
to go about on wheels. But better evidence still
is found in the establishment, May 1677, of the
Worshipful Company of Coach and Harness
Makers, whose arms still bear representations of
the carriages in use at that period. The armorial
bearings of the Coach-makers are, when duly
tricked out in their proper colours, somewhat
striking. Stated in plain terms, done into English
out of heraldic jargon, they consist of a blue
shield of arms with three coaches and a chevron
in gold, supported on either side by a golden horse,
harnessed and saddled in black studded with gold;
with blue housings garnished with red, and
fringed and purfled in gold. The horses are
further adorned with plumes of four feathers in
gold, silver, red, and blue. A crest above displays<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
Phœbus driving his chariot, and the motto beneath
declares that “After clouds rises the sun.”</p>

<p>The hackney-carriages of London in 1669, the
year following Pepys’ establishment of his own
private turn-out, numbered, according to the
memoirs of Cosmo, Grand Duke of Tuscany, who
travelled England at that time, eight hundred.
The age of public vehicles was come.</p>

</div>

<blockquote>
<p>“The single gentlemen, then a hardy race, equipped in jack-boots
and trousers up to their middle, rode post through thick and thin,
and, guarded against the mire, defying the frequent stumble and fall,
arose and pursued their journey with alacrity.”—<cite>Pennant</cite>, 1739.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="p2 in0"><span class="smcap">Long</span> before wheeled conveyances of any kind
were to be hired in this country, travellers were
accustomed to ride post. To do so argued no
connection with that great department we now
call the Post Office, although that letter-carrying
agency and the custom of riding post obtain
their name from a common origin. The earliest
provision for travelling post seems to have been
in the reign of Henry VIII., when the office of
“Master of the Postes” was established. Sir
Brian Tuke then held that appointment, and to
him were entrusted the arrangements for securing
relays of horses on the four great post roads then
recognised: the road from London to Dover, on
which the carriers came from and went to foreign
parts; the road to Plymouth, where the King’s
dockyard was situated; and the great roads to
Scotland and Chester, and on to Conway and Holyhead.
These relays of horses were established
exclusively for use of the despatch-riders who went
on affairs of State; but by the time of Elizabeth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
these messengers were, as a favour, already
accustomed to carry any letters that might be
given into their charge and could be delivered
without going out of their way; while travellers
constantly called at the country post-houses, and
on pretence of going on the Queen’s business,
obtained the use of horses, which they rode to
exhaustion, or overloaded, or even rode away with
altogether.</p>

<p>These abuses were promptly suppressed when
James I. came to the English throne. In 1603,
the year of his accession, a proclamation was issued
under which no person claiming to be on Government
business was to be supplied with horses
by the postmasters unless his application was
supported by a document signed by one of the
officers of State. The hire of horses for public
business was fixed at twopence-halfpenny a mile,
and in addition there was a small charge for the
guide. A very arbitrary order was made that if
the post-houses had not sufficient horses, the
constables and the magistrates were to seize those
of private owners and impress them into the
service. Post-masters, who were salaried officials,
were paid at the very meagre rate of from sixpence
to three shillings a day. They were
generally innkeepers on the main roads; otherwise
it is difficult to see how they could have
existed on these rates of pay. Evidently these
were considered merely as retaining fees, and so,
in order to give them a chance of earning a more
living wage, they were permitted to let out horses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
to “others riding poste with horse and guide about
their private business.” Those private and unofficial
travellers could not demand to be supplied
with horses at the official rate: what they were to
pay was to be a matter between the post-masters
and themselves. In practice, however, the tariff
for Government riders ruled that for all horsemen,
as made clear in Fynes Morison’s <i>Itinerary</i>, 1617,
where he says that in the south and west of
England and on the Great North Road as far as
Berwick, post-horses were established at every ten
miles or so at a charge of twopence-halfpenny a
mile. It was necessary to have a guide to each
stage, and it was customary to charge for baiting
both the guide’s and the traveller’s horses, and to
give the guide himself a few pence—usually a four-penny-piece,
called “the guide’s groat”—on parting.
It was cheaper and safer for several travellers to
go together, for one guide would serve the whole
company on each stage, and it was not prudent to
travel alone. Morison says that, although hiring
came expensive in one way, yet the speed it was
possible to maintain saved time and consequent
charges at the inns. The chief requisite, however,
was strength of body and ability to endure the
fatigue.</p>

<p>As to that, the horsemen of the period were,
equally with those of over a hundred years later,
mentioned by Pennant, “a hardy race.” In
March, 1603, for example, Robert Cary, afterwards
Earl of Monmouth, eager to be first in acclaiming
James VI. of Scotland as James I. of England,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
left London so soon as the last breath had
left the body of Queen Elizabeth, and rode
the 401 miles to Edinburgh in three days. He
reached Doncaster, 158 miles, the first night,
Widdrington, 137 miles, the second, and gained
Edinburgh, 106 miles, the third day, in spite of a
severe fall by the way. About the same time a
person named Coles rode from London to Shrewsbury
in fourteen hours.</p>

<p>When Thomas Witherings was appointed Master
of the Post, in 1635, the Post Office, as an institution
for carrying the correspondence of the public,
may be said to have started business, although
as early as 1603 private persons were forbidden to
make the carrying of letters a business. Like all
such ordinances, this seemed made only to be
broken every day. It was particularly unreasonable
because, before Witherings came upon the
scene in 1635 and reorganised the posts, there
existed no means by which letters could be sent
generally into the country. Only the post-riders
on business of State on the four great roads were
in the habit of taking letters, and their doing
so was a matter of private arrangement.</p>

<p>The postmasters now, on the appointment of
Witherings, first officially made acquaintance
with letters, and their name began to take on
something of its modern meaning. They still
supplied horses to the King’s messengers and the
King’s liege subjects, and held a monopoly in
these businesses.</p>

<p>In 1657 the so-called “Post Office of England”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
was established by Act of Parliament, and the
office of Postmaster-General created, in succession
to that of Master of the Posts. His business was
defined as “the exclusive right of carrying letters
and the furnishing of post-horses,” and these
two functions—the overlordship of what were
officially known for generations afterwards as the
“letter post” and the “travelling post”—the
long line of Postmasters-General continued to
exercise for a hundred and twenty-three years.</p>

<p>In 1658 the mileage the country postmasters
were entitled to charge was, according to an
advertisement of July 1st in that year, increased
from twopence-halfpenny to threepence, and on
the Chester Road, at least, there was no longer
any obligation to take a <span class="locked">guide:—</span></p>

<p>“The postmasters on the Chester Road, petitioning,
have received order, and do accordingly
publish the following advertisement: All gentlemen,
merchants, and others who have occasion to
travel between London and West Chester, Manchester,
and Warrington, or any other town upon
that road, for the accommodation of trade, dispatch
of business, and ease of purse, upon every Monday,
Wednesday and Friday morning, between six and
ten of the clock, at the house of Mr. Christopher
Charteris, at the sign of the Hart’s Horns, in West
Smithfield, and postmaster there, and at the postmaster
of Chester, and at the postmaster of
Warrington, may have a good and able horse or
mare, furnished at threepence the mile, without
the charge of a guide; and so likewise at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
house of Mr. Thomas Challoner, postmaster at
Stone in Staffordshire, upon every Tuesday,
Thursday, and Saturday mornings, to go to
London; and so likewise at all the several postmasters
upon the road, who will have such set
days, so many horses, with furniture, in readiness
to furnish the riders, without any stay, to carry
them to and from any of the places aforesaid in
four days, as well to London as from thence, and
to places nearer in less time, according as their
occasions shall require, they engaging, at the first
stage where they take horse, for the safe delivery
of the same to the next immediate stage, and not
to ride that horse any farther without consent of
the postmaster, by whom he rides, and so from
stage to stage to their journey’s end. All those
who intend to ride this way are desired to give a
little notice beforehand, if conveniently they can,
to the several postmasters where they first take
horse, whereby they may be furnished with as
many horses as the riders shall require, with
expedition. This undertaking began the 28th of
June 1658, at all the places aforesaid, and so
continues by the several postmasters.”</p>

<p>The Chester Road—the road to Ireland—was
of great moment at that age. Indeed, it had
been of importance for centuries past. It was in
a lonely hollow near Flint, on his landing from
Ireland, that Richard II. was waylaid in
1399 by Henry Bolingbroke, and his progress to
London barred; and from Chester as well as from
Milford Haven English expeditions were wont to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
sail—some carrying fire and sword across St.
George’s Channel, and later ones taking English
colonists to occupy and cultivate the lands from
which the shiftless Irish had been driven. But it
was not until the close of Elizabeth’s reign, when
Ireland was subjugated, that this road began to be
constantly travelled.</p>

<p>Under James I. the Irish chieftains came to
these shores to swear fealty, and in the wild and
whirling series of events that filled the years
from 1641 to 1692 with horror, a continual flux
and reflux of military travellers and trembling
refugees came and went along these storied miles.</p>

<p>Already, in the year before the announcement
of post-horses on the Chester Road, the first stage-coach
of which we have any particulars had been
established on this very route. It did not
continue to Holyhead, for the individually
sufficient reasons that no practicable road to that
port existed for anything going on wheels, and
that Chester itself, and Parkgate, a few miles
down the estuary of the Dee, were the most convenient
ports of embarkation for Ireland. No
direct road to Holyhead existed until 1783, when
coaches began to run to that port. Before that
time, those who wished to cross from Holyhead
generally rode horseback. Few ventured across
country by Llangollen and Bettws-y-Coed; most,
like Swift, leaving civilisation behind at Chester,
took horse and guide, and going by Rhuddlan and
Conway, dared the precipitous heights of that
great headland called Penmaenmawr, or, even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
more greatly daring, crept round by the rocks
underneath at ebb tide. Swift wrote two couplets
for the inn that then stood beside the track on
Penmaenmawr. As the traveller approached he
read, on the swinging <span class="locked">sign:—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Before you venture here to pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take a good refreshing glass;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">while the returning wayfarer was cheered <span class="locked">by:—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now this hill you’re safely over,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drink, your spirits to recover.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>One personage, greatly daring, did in 1685
succeed in passing his carriage over this height.
This was the Viceroy, Henry, Earl of Clarendon,
who, ill enough advised to try for Holyhead,
embarked his baggage at Chester, and essayed this
perilous undertaking. “If the weather be good,”
he wrote, before setting out, “we go under the
rocks in our coaches.” But it was December, the
weather was <em>not</em> good, and so they had to take to
the hill-top. His Excellency had ample cause to
regret the venture, for he was five hours travelling
the fourteen miles between St. Asaph and Conway,
and on the crossing of Penmaenmawr the “great
heavy coach” had to be drawn by the horses in
single trace, while three or four sturdy Welsh
peasants, hired for the job, pushed behind, so that
it should not slip back. His Excellency walked
all the way across, from Conway to Bangor, and
Lady Clarendon was carried in a litter. How the
Menai Straits were crossed does not appear, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
there is evidence in the tone of his letters that he
was astonished at last to find himself safely come
to Holyhead.</p>

<p>In 1660, on the Restoration, the law of 1657,
constituting the Post Office and regulating the
letting of post-horses, was re-enacted. By some
new provisions and amendments of old ones,
travellers might now hire horses wherever they
could if the postmasters could not supply them
within half an hour. This concession, together
with that which repealed the power given by the
earlier Act for horses to be seized, was evidently
made in deference to the indignation of travellers
delayed by lack of horses in the hands of the
only persons who could legally hire them out,
and by the fury of private individuals who had
seen their own choice animals not infrequently
requisitioned in the King’s name and hack-ridden
unconscionable distances by travellers or
King’s messengers whose first and last thoughts
were for speed, and who had not the consideration
of an owner for the steeds that carried them. The
term “postage,” occurring in the Act of 1660,
shows that a widely different meaning was then
attached to the word: “Each horse’s hire or
postage” is a phrase that sufficiently explains
itself.</p>

<p>Such were the methods and costs of riding horseback
when stage-coaching began. The Government
monopoly, however, was infringed with increasing
impunity as time went on, and as the letter-carrying
business of the Post Office developed, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
was the “travelling post” allowed to decay. The
growing number and increasing convenience of
the coaches, too, helped to make the monopoly less
valuable, for when travellers could be conveyed
without exertion by coach at from twopence to
threepence a mile, they were not likely to pay
threepence a mile and a guide’s groat at every
ten miles for the privilege of bumping in the
saddle all day long. Those who mostly continued
in the saddle were the gentlemen who owned
horses of their own, or those others to whom the
chance company of a coach was objectionable.</p>

<p>The Post Office monopoly in post-horses was,
accordingly, not worth preserving when it was
abolished by the Act of 1780. From that time
the Postmasters-General ceased to have anything
to do with horse-hire, and anything lost by their
relinquishing it was amply returned to the State
by the new license duties levied upon horse-keepers
or postmasters, and coaches. A penny a mile was
fixed as the Government duty upon horses let out
for hire, whether saddle-horses or to be used in
post-chaises. All persons who made that a business—generally,
of course, innkeepers—were to take
out an annual five-shilling license, and were under
obligation to paint in some conspicuous place on
their houses “Licensed to let Post-Horses.” In
default of so doing the penalty was £5. As a
check upon the business done, travellers hiring
post-horses were to be given a ticket, on which the
number of horses so hired, and the distance, were
to be specified. These tickets were to be delivered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
to the turnpike-keeper at the first gate, and the
vigilance of these officials was made a matter of
self-interest by the allowance to them of threepence
in the pound on all tickets thus collected.
At certain periods the tickets were delivered to
the Stamp Office, and the innkeepers and postmasters
themselves were visited by revenue
officers, who required to see the books and the
counterfoils from which these tickets had come.</p>

<p>But the Government did not for any length
of time directly collect these duties. They were
farmed out by the Inland Revenue Department,
just as the turnpike tolls were farmed by the
Turnpike Trustees, and men grew rich by buying
these tolls and duties at annual auctions, relying
for their profit on the increased vigilance they
would cause to be exercised. The Jews were
early in this field. In the golden era of coaching
a man named Levy farmed tolls and duties to the
annual value of half a million sterling.</p>

<p>But to return to our horsemen. In the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the country
gentlemen, the members of Parliament, the judges
on circuit, every hale and able-bodied man of means
sufficient, rode his horse, or hired one on his
journeys, for the reason that carriages could only
slowly and with great difficulty and expense be
made to move along the distant roads. The
passage from Pennant’s recollections, quoted at
the head of this chapter, shows the miseries made
light of by the single gentlemen, and endured by
those married ones whose wives rode behind them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
on a pillion and clutched them convulsively round
the waist as the horse stumbled along.</p>

<p>Nor did stage-coaches immediately change this
time-honoured way of getting about the country,
for there existed an aristocratic prejudice against
using public vehicles. Offensive persons who
never owned carriages of their own were used to
give themselves insufferable airs when journeying
by coach, and hint, for the admiration or envy
of their fellow-passengers, that an accident had
happened to their own private equipage. Satirists
of the time soon seized upon this contemptible
resort of the snob, and used it to advantage in
contemporary literature. Thus we find the committeeman’s
wife in Sir Robert Howard’s comedy
explaining her presence in the Reading coach to
be owing to her own carriage being disordered,
adding that if her husband knew she had been
obliged to ride in the stage he would “make the
house too hot to hold some.”</p>

<p>Here and there we find exceptions to this
general rule. In the coach passing through
Preston in 1662, one Parker was fellow-traveller
with “persons of great qualitie, such as knightes
and ladyes”; and on one occasion in 1682 the winter
coach on its four days’ journey between Nottingham
and London had for passenger Sir Ralph
Knight, of Langold, Yorks; but the single gentlemen
in good health continued for years after the
introduction of stage-coaches to go on horseback,
and when their families came to town they usually
took the family chariot, and either contracted with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
stable-keepers for horses on the way, or else,
taking their most powerful horses from the plough,
harnessed four or six of them to their private
vehicle, and so, with the driving of their best
ploughman, came to the capital in state, much to
the amusement of the fashionables of Piccadilly
and St. James’s.</p>

<p>We must, however, suppose, from the fury of
Cresset’s <i>Reasons for Suppressing Stage Coaches</i>, of
1662, that some of the less energetic among the
country gentlemen had already succumbed to
the discreditable practice of travelling in them.
In his pages we learn something of what a
horseman’s life on the road was like, and what
he escaped by taking to the coach. The hardy
race became soft and grievously enervated by the
unwonted luxury; their muscles slackened, and
they developed an infirmity of purpose that
rendered them no longer able to “endure frost,
snow, or rain, or to lodge in the fields”—trifling
inconveniences and incidents of travel which, it
appears, they had previously been accustomed to
support with that cheerfulness or resignation with
which one faces the inevitable and incurable.</p>

<p>But Cresset had other indictments, throwing a
flood of light upon what the horseman endured in
wear and tear of body, mind, and wearing apparel:
“Most gentlemen, before they travelled in
coaches, used to ride with swords, belts, pistols,
holsters, portmanteaus and hat-cases, which in
these coaches they have little or no use for; for,
when they rode on horseback, they rode in one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
suit and carried another to wear when they came
to their journey’s end, or lay by the way; but
in coaches a silk hat and an Indian gown, with
a sash, silk stockings, and beaver hats, men ride
in, and carry no other with them, because they
escape the wet and dirt, which on horseback they
cannot avoid; whereas, in two or three journeys
on horseback these clothes and hats were wont
to be spoiled; which done, they were forced to
have new ones very often, and that increased the
consumption of the manufactures and the employment
of the manufacturers; which travelling
in coaches doth in no way do.”</p>

<p>Fortunately, the biographical literature of our
country is rich in records of the horsemen who,
still relying upon their own exertions and those
of their willing steeds, rode long distances and
left the toiling stage leagues behind them at the
close of each day’s journey. Ralph Thoresby, of
Leeds, a pious and God-fearing antiquary who
flourished at this time, gives us, on the other
hand, the spectacle of one who generally rode
horseback trying the coach by way of a change.
He had occasion to visit London in February 1683,
and as there was at that time no coach service
between Leeds and London, he rode from Leeds to
York to catch the stage, which seems to have kept
the road in this particular winter. He rose at five
one Saturday morning, and was at York by night,
ready for the coach leaving for London on the
Monday. Four years earlier he had scorned the
coach, and did not now take it for sake of speed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
for he commonly rode from Leeds to London in
four days, and the York stage at this period of its
career took six; so, including the two days expended
in coming to York, he was clearly twice
as long over the business. He looked forward to
the coach journey with misgivings, “fearful of
being confined to a coach for so many days with
unsuitable persons and not one I know of.”</p>

<p>On other occasions, when he rode horseback,
his diary is rich with picturesque incident. He
finds the waters out on the road between Ware
and Cheshunt, and waits until he and a party of
other horsemen can be guided across by a safe
way, and so avoid the pitiful fate of a poor higgler,
who blundered into the raging torrent where the
road should have been, and was swept away and
drowned. He loses his way frequently on the
high-road; shudders with apprehension when
crossing Witham Common, near Stamford, “the
place where Sir Ralph Wharton slew the highwayman”;
and, with a companion, has a terrible
fright at an inn at Topcliffe, where they miss
their pistols for a while and suspect the innkeeper
of sinister designs against them. Hence,
at the safe conclusion of every journey, with
humble and heartfelt thanks he inscribes: “God
be thanked for his mercies to me and my poor
family!”</p>

<p>In 1715, when John Gay wrote his entertaining
poem, <i>A Journey to Exeter</i>, describing the adventures
of a party of horsemen who rode down from
London, things were, we may suppose, much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
better, for the travellers found amusement as well
as toil on their way.</p>

<p>They took five days to ride to Exeter. The
first night they slept at Hartley Row, 36 miles.
The second day they left the modern route of
the Exeter Road at Basingstoke, and, like some
of the coaches about that time, struck out along
the Winchester road as far as Popham Lane, where
they branched off across the downs to Sutton and
Stockbridge, at which town they halted the night,
after a day’s journey of 30 miles. The third
morning saw them making for Salisbury. Midway
between Stockbridge and that city their road falls
into the main road to Exeter. That night they
were at Blandford. The fourth day took them to
Axminster, and the fifth to <span class="locked">Exeter:—</span></p>

<p>Dean Swift, too, was a frequent traveller on
horseback, particularly on the Chester and Holyhead
road. He seems once to have tried the
Chester stage, and ever after to have taken to
the saddle. Riding thus in 1710 from Chester
to London in five days, he describes himself as
“weary the first, almost dead the second, tolerable
the third, and well enough the rest,” but
“glad enough of the fatigue, which has served
for exercise.” After making the journey from
London to Holyhead and Dublin in 1726, he wrote
to Pope, describing “the quick change” he had
made in seven days from London to Dublin,
“through many nations and languages unknown
to the civilised world.” He had expected the
enterprise, “with moderate fortune,” to take ten
or eleven days. “I have often reflected,” he adds,
“in how few hours, with a swift horse or a strong
gale, a man may come among a people as unknown
to him as the Antipodes.” Swift was by no means
indulging in playful banter when he wrote this.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
He felt a genuine cause for wonder in such
expedition; and certainly if the rustic speech of
rural England was like a strange and uncivilised
tongue, how much more strange and uncivilised
the languages of Wales and Ireland must have
sounded!</p>

<p>The Dean’s last recorded journey was made in
September 1727. The little memorandum-book,
tattered and discoloured, in which he noted down
many of its incidents is still in existence, and is
not only a valuable document in the story of
Swift’s life, but is equally precious and interesting
as an intimate record of the daily trials and
troubles of a traveller in those times, set down
while he was still on his journey and thus echoing
every passing feeling. Swift was in bad health
and worse spirits when he wrote this diary at
Holyhead, where he was detained for seven days
by contrary winds. It was written for lack of
employment afforded to a cultivated mind in
the dreary little seaport, and under the influence
of a great sorrow. “Stella” lay dying over in
Ireland, and he, raging with impatience at Holyhead,
filled his notebook with aimless scribbling.
“All this to divert thinking,” he writes, sadly, in
the midst of it.</p>

<p>The original notebook is still in existence, and
is carefully preserved at the South Kensington
Museum, to which it was bequeathed by John
Forster. Inside its cover the handwriting of
successive owners gives the relic an authentic
pedigree, and Swift himself humorously declares<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
how he came into possession of the blank book:
“This book I stole from the Right Honourable
George Dodington, Esq., one of the Lords of the
Treasury, but the scribblings are all my own.”
This George Dodington was George Bubb
Dodington, afterwards Lord Melcombe.</p>

<p>On the first page are hastily-scribbled memoranda
for appointments: “In Fleet Street,
about a clerk of St. Patrick’s Cathedral”;
“Spectacles for seventy years old”; “Godfrey
in Southampton Street”; “Hungary waters and
palsy drops.”</p>

<p>Then the Dean left London, riding horseback,
with his servant, Watt, for company on another
nag, and carrying his master’s travelling valise.
The heavy luggage had been sent on by waggon
to Chester. Watt, as we shall presently see, was
a veritable Handy Andy, always doing the wrong
thing, or the right thing in a wrong way. Swift
carried the notebook in his pocket, without writing
anything of his journey in it until Holyhead was
reached.</p>

<p>A few unfinished lines on an old cassock,
out at elbows, preface the diary, which begins
abruptly: “Friday at 11 in the morning I left
Chester. It was Sept. 22, 1727. I baited at
a blind ale house 7 miles from Chester. I
thence rode to Ridland (Rhuddlan), in all 22
miles. I lay there: bred, bed, meat and tolerable
wine. I left Ridland a quarter after 4 morn on
Saturday, slept, on Penmanmaur (Penmaenmawr),
examined about my sign verses the Inn is to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
be on t’other side, therefore the verses to be
changed.”<a id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_A" href="#FNanchor_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> See <a href="#Page_21">p. 21.</a></p></div>

<p>Here, on the verge of the wild Welsh coast,
the way was so uncertain and dangerous that
travellers had of necessity to employ guides, who
conducted them thence to Bangor, and across
Anglesey to Holyhead. The roads in Anglesey
were unworthy of the name, and only a little
better than horse-tracks; while the inhabitants
of the isle spoke only Welsh, and understood
not a word of English. Nearly two hundred
years have passed, but although the roads
have been made good, the folks of Anglesey
speak English no more than they did then,
when the guides acted the part of interpreters
as well.</p>

<p>Swift, therefore, is found at Conway, mentioning
the guide who had already brought
him safely over Penmaenmawr: “I baited at
Conway, the guide going to another Inn; the
maid of the old Inn saw me in the street and
said that was my horse, she knew me. There I
dined, and sent for Ned Holland, a Squire famous
for being mentioned in Mr. Lyndsay’s verses to
Day Morice. I there again saw Hook’s tomb,
who was the 41st child of his mother, and had
himself 27 children, he dyed about 1638. There
is a note here that one of his posterity new
furbished up the inscription. I had read in Abp.
Williams’ Life that he was buryed in an obscure
Church in North Wales. I enquired, and heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
that it was at<a id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> ... Church, within a mile of
Bangor, whither I was going. I went to the
Church, the guide grumbling. I saw the Tomb
with his Statue kneeling (in marble). It began
thus (Hospes lege et relege quod in hoc obscuro
sacello non expectares. Hic jacet omnium
Praesulum celeberrimus). I came to Bangor and
crossed the Ferry, a mile from it, where there
is an Inn, which, if it be well kept, will break
Bangor. There I lay; it was 22 miles from
Holyhead.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_B" href="#FNanchor_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> It was Llandegai.</p></div>

<p>This was the “George” at Menai Straits, a
house that until the building of Telford’s suspension
bridge in 1825, flourished greatly on the
traffic of the ferry that then plied between it and
the opposite shore. Large additions have been
made to the hotel, but the original wing that
Swift knew is still in existence, and is a characteristic
specimen of the architecture in vogue about
the time of Queen Anne.</p>

<p>Swift unfortunately tells us nothing of the
actual crossing of the Straits. He must have
been up at an unconscionable hour, for he was
already on the Anglesey side by four o’clock the
next morning, Sunday: “I was on horseback at
4 in the morning resolving to be at Church at
Holyhead, but we then lost Owain Tudor’s tomb at
Penmarry.” This was Penmynydd, a very steep
and craggy place, whence came those Tudors who
through the fortunate marriage of Owain Tudor
came at last to the throne of England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
“We passed the place,” says Swift, “being a
little out of the way, by the Guide’s knavery, who
had no mind to stay. I was now so weary with
riding that I was forced to stop at Langueveny
(Llangefni), 7 miles from the Ferry, and rest two
hours. Then I went on very weary, but in a few
miles more Watt’s horse lost his two fore-shoes.
So the Horse was forced to limp after us. The
Guide was less concerned than I. In a few miles
more my Horse lost a fore-shoe and could not go
on the rocky ways. I walked above two miles,
to spare him. It was Sunday, and no Smith to
be got. At last there was a Smith in the way:
we left the Guide to shoe the horses and walked
to a hedge Inn 3 miles from Holyhead. There
I stayed an hour with no ale to be drunk. A
boat offered, and I went by sea and sayled in it
to Holyhead. The Guide came about the same
time. I dined with an old Innkeeper, Mrs. Welch,
about 3, on a Loyne of mutton very good, but the
worst ale in the world, and no wine, for the day
before I came here a vast number went to Ireland
after having drunk out all the wine. There was
stale beer, and I tryed a receit of Oyster shells
which I got powdered on purpose; but it was
good for nothing. I walked on the rocks in the
evening, and then went to bed and dreamt I
had got 20 falls from my Horse.</p>

<p>“<i>Monday, Sept. 25.</i>—The Captain talks of
sailing at 12. The talk goes off, the wind is fair,
but he says it is too fierce. I believe he wants
more Company. I had a raw Chicken for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
dinner and Brandy with water for my drink. I
walked morning and afternoon among the rocks.
This evening Watt tells me that my landady
whispered him that the Grafton packet-boat just
come in had brought her 18 bottles of Irish
Claret. I secured one, and supped on part of a
neat’s tongue which a friend at London had given
Watt to put up for me, and drank a pint of the
wine, which was bad enough. Not a soul is yet
come to Holyhead, except a young fellow who
smiles when he meets me and would fain be my
companion, but it has not come to that yet. I
writ abundance of verses this day; and several
useful hints, tho’ I say it. I went to bed at ten
and dreamt abundance of nonsense.</p>

<p>“<i>Tuesday 26th.</i>—I am forced to wear a shirt
3 days for fear of being lowsy. I was sparing
of them all the way. It was a mercy there were
6 clean when I left London;—otherwise Watt
(whose blunders would bear an history) would
have got them all in the great Box of goods which
went by the Carrier to Chester. He brought but
one crevat, and the reason he gave was because the
rest were foul and he thought he should not get
foul linen into the Portmanteau. For he never
dreamt it might be washed on the way. My
shirts are all foul now, and by his reasoning I
fear he will leave them at Holyhead when we go.
I got a small Loyn of mutton but so tough I could
not chew it, and drank my second pint of wine.
I walked this morning a good way among the
rocks, and to a hole in one of them from whence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
at certain periods the water spurted up several
feet high. It rained all night and hath rained
since dinner. But now the sun shines and I will
take my afternoon walk. It was fiercer and
wilder weather than yesterday, yet the Captain now
dreams of sailing. To say the truth Michaelmas is
the worst season in the year. Is this strange stuff?
Why, what would you have me do? I have writ
verses and put down hints till I am weary. I
see no creature. I cannot read by candle-light.
Sleeping will make me sick. I reckon myself
fixed here, and have a mind like Marshall Tallard
to take a house and garden. I wish you a Merry
Christmas and expect to see you by Candlemas.
I have walked this morning about 3 miles on
the rocks; my giddiness, God be thanked, is almost
gone and my hearing continues. I am now
retired to my chamber to scribble or sit
humdrum. The night is fair and they pretend to
have some hopes of going to-morrow.</p>

<p>“<i>September 26th.</i>—Thoughts upon being confined
at Holyhead. If this were to be my settlement
during life I could content myself a while by
forming new conveniences to be easy, and should
not be frightened either by the solitude or the
meanness of lodging, eating or drinking. I shall
say nothing about the suspense I am in about my
dearest friend because that is a case extraordinary,
and therefore by way of comfort. I will speak as
if it were not in my thoughts, and only as a
passenger who is in a scurvy, unprovided comfortless
place without one companion, and who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
therefore wants to be at home where he hath all
conveniences proper for a gentleman of quality.
I cannot read at night, and I have no books to
read in the day. I have no subject at present in
my head to write upon. I dare not send my linen
to be washed for fear of being called away at half
an hour’s warning, and then I must leave them
behind, which is a serious Point. I live at great
expense without one comfortable bit or sup. I
am afraid of joyning with passengers for fear of
getting acquaintance with Irish. The days are
short and I have five hours a night to spend by
myself before I go to Bed. I should be glad to
converse with Farmers or shopkeepers, but none
of them speak English. A Dog is better company
than the Vicar, for I remember him of old. What
can I do but write everything that comes into my
head? Watt is a booby of that species which I
dare not suffer to be familiar with me, for he
would ramp on my shoulders in half an hour.
But the worst part is in my half-hourly longing,
and hopes and vain expectations of a wind, so that
I live in suspense which is the worst circumstance
of human nature. I am a little wrung from two
scurvy disorders, and if I should relapse there is
not a Welsh house-cur that would not have more
care taken of him than I, and whose loss would
not be more lamented. I confine myself to my
narrow chamber in all unwalkable hours. The
Master of the pacquet-boat, one Jones, hath not
treated me with the least civility, although Watt
gave him my name. In short I come from being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
used like an Emperor to be used worse than a Dog
at Holyhead. Yet my hat is worn to pieces by
answering the civilities of the poor inhabitants as
they pass by. The women might be safe enough
who all wear hats yet never pull them off, and if
the dirty streets did not foul their petticoats by
courtesying so low. Look you; be not impatient,
for I only wait till my watch makes 10 and then
I will give you ease and myself sleep, if I can.
O’ my conscience you may know a Welsh dog as
well as a Welsh man or woman, by its peevish
passionate way of barking. This paper shall serve
to answer all your questions about my journey,
and I will have it printed to satisfy the kingdom.
<i>Forsan et haec olim</i> is a damned lye, for I shall
always fret at the remembrance of this imprisonment.
Pray pity your Watt for he is called
dunce, puppy and lyar 500 times an hour, and
yet he means not ill for he means nothing.
Oh for a dozen bottles of Deanery wine and a slice
of bread and butter! The wine you sent us
yesterday is a little upon the sour. I wish you
had chosen a better. I am going to bed at ten
o’clock because I am weary of being up.</p>

<p>“<i>Wednesday.</i>—To-day we were certainly to
sayl: the morning was calm. Watt and I walked
up the mountain Marucia, properly called Holyhead
or Sacrum Promontorium by Ptolemy,
2 miles from this town. I took breath 59 times.
I looked from the top to see the Wicklow hills, but
the day was too hazy, which I felt to my sorrow;
for returning we were overtaken by a furious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
shower. I got into a Welsh cabin almost as bad
as an Irish one. There were only an old Welsh
woman sifting flour who understood no English,
and a boy who fell a roaring for fear of me.
Watt (otherwise called unfortunate Jack) ran
home for my coat, but stayed so long that I came
home in worse rain without him, and he was so
lucky to miss me, but took good care to convey
the key of my room where a fire was ready for me.
So I cooled my heels in the Parlour till he came,
but called for a glass of Brandy. I have been
cooking myself dry, and am now in my night
gown.... And so I wait for dinner. I shall
dine like a King all alone, as I have done these
six days. As it happened, if I had gone straight
from Chester to Park-gate 8 miles I should have
been in Dublin on Sunday last. Now Michaelmas
approaches, the worst time in the year for the sea,
and this rain has made these parts unwalkable,
so I must either write or doze. Bite, when we
were in the wild cabin I order Watt to take a
cloth and wipe my wet gown and cassock: it
happened to be a meal-bag, and as my gown dryed
it was all daubed with flour well cemented with
the rain. What do I but see the gown and cassock
well dryed in my room, and while Watt was at
dinner I was an hour rubbing the meal out of
them, and did it exactly. He is just come up,
and I have gravely bid him take them down to
rub them, and I wait whether he will find out
what I have been doing. The Rogue is come up
in six minutes, and says there were but few specks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
(tho’ he saw a thousand at first), but neither
wondered at it, nor seemed to suspect me who
laboured like a horse to rub them out. The 3
packet boats are now all on their side, and the
weather grown worse, and so much rain that there
is an end of my walking. I wish you would send
me word how I shall dispose of my time. I am
as insignificant a person here as parson Brooke is
in Dublin; by my conscience I believe Cæsar
would be the same without his army at his back.
Well, the longer I stay here the more you will
murmur for want of packets. Whoever would
wish to live long should live here, for a day is
longer than a week, and if the weather be foul,
as long as a fortnight. Yet here I could live
with two or three friends in a warm house and good
wine; much better than being a slave in Ireland.
But my misery is that I am in the very worst
part of Wales under the very worst circumstances,
afraid of a relapse, in utmost solitude, impatient
for the condition of our friend, not a soul to
converse with, hindered from exercise by rain,
caged up in a room not half so large as one of
the Deanery closets; my Room smokes into the
bargain, but the weather is too cold and moist
to be without a fire. There is or should be
a proverb here: When Mrs. Welch’s chimney
smokes, ’Tis a sign she’ll keep her folks, But
when of smoke the room is clear, It is a sign
we shan’t stay here. All this to divert thinking.
Tell me, am not I a comfortable wag? The
Yatcht is to leave for Lord Carteret on the 14th<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
of October. I fancy he and I shall come over
together. I have opened my door to let in the
wind that it may drive out the smoke. I asked
the wind why he is so cross; he assures me ’tis
not his fault, but his cursed Master, Eolus’s.
Here is a young Jackanapes in the Inn waiting
for a wind who would fain be my companion, and
if I stay here much longer I am afraid all my
pride and grandeur will truckle to comply with
him, especially if I finish these leaves that remain;
but I will write close and do as the Devil did at
mass, pull the paper with my teeth to make it
hold out.</p>

<p>“<i>Thursday.</i>—’Tis allowed that we learn patience
by suffering. I have not spirit enough now left me
to fret. I was so cunning these three last days that
whenever I began to rage and storm at the weather
I took special care to turn my face towards Ireland,
in hope by my breath to push the wind forward.
But now I give up.... Well, it is now three in
the afternoon. I have dined and revisited the
master; the wind and tide serve, and I am just
taking boat to go to the ship. So adieu till I see
you at the Deanery.</p>

<p>“<i>Friday, Michaelmas Day.</i>—You will now know
something of what it is to be at sea. We had not
been half an hour in the ship till a fierce wind rose
directly against us; we tryed a good while, but the
storm still continued; so we turned back, and it
was 8 at night dark and rainy before the ship
got back, and at anchor. The other passengers
went back in a boat to Holyhead; but to prevent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
accidents and broken shins I lay all night on
board, and came back this morning at 8. Am
now in my chamber, where I must stay and get
a fresh stock of patience.”</p>

  <div class="caption smaller hang">EPIGRAM SCRATCHED WITH A DIAMOND-RING
ON A WINDOW-PANE BY DEAN SWIFT.</div></div>

<p>So ends this curious diary. This is the last
time that Swift is known to have visited England,
and it has always been assumed, from the lack of
evidence of his again touching these shores, that
he never did return. But he was mentally active
until 1736, and it was not until 1745 that he died,
in madness and old
age. Meanwhile,
there still exists indisputable
evidence
of his travelling
along the Holyhead
Road in 1730; for
an old diamond-shaped
pane of glass,
formerly in a
window of the
“Four Crosses” Inn at Willoughby, and deeply
tinged with a greenish hue, as much old glass
commonly is, may be found in private possession
at Rugby, inscribed by him with a diamond ring.
The handwriting compares exactly with that of
his diary and other manuscripts still extant, and
the ferocity of the humour in the lines is characteristic
of him. Other windows, at Chester and
elsewhere, are known to have been inscribed by
him with epigrams and satirical verses, but they
do not appear to have survived. The occasion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
his offering this advice to the landlord of what was
then the “Three Crosses” has always been said to
have been the landlady’s disregard of his importance.
Anxious to set off early in the morning, he
could by no means hurry the good woman over the
preparation of his breakfast. She told him; “he
must wait, like other people.” He waited, of
necessity, but employed the time in this manner.</p>

<p>John Wesley was of this varied company of
horsemen, and in a long series of years rode into
every nook and corner of England. His “Journal,”
abounding with details of his adventures on
these occasions, proves him to have been a hard
rider and among the most robust and enduring of
travellers in that age. He rode incredible distances
in the day, very frequently from sixty to
seventy miles. Once, in 1738, he travelled in this
way from London to Shipston-on-Stour, a distance
of 82¾ miles, and ended the long day, as usual
with him, in religious counsel. “About eight,”
he says, “it being rainy and very dark, we lost
our way, but before nine came into Shipston,
having rode over, I know not how, a narrow
footbridge which lay across a deep ditch near the
town. After supper I read prayers to the people
of the inn, and explained the Second Lesson; I
hope not in vain.” The next day this indefatigable
traveller and missioner rode 59 miles, to
Birmingham, Hednesford, and Stafford; and the
next a further 53 miles, to Manchester, feeling
faint (and no wonder!) on the way, at Altrincham.
In November 1745, riding from Newcastle-on-Tyne<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
to Wednesbury, he did not experience many
difficulties until he came, in the dark, to Wednesbury
Town-end, where he and his companion
stuck fast. That is indeed a bad road in which
a horse sticks. However, people coming with
candles, Wesley himself got out of the quagmire
and went off to preach, while the horses were
disengaged from their awkward position by local
experts. The spot where Wesley was bogged is
now a broad and firm macadamised road through
Wednesbury, part of the great Holyhead Road.
Eighteen years before this happening, an Act of
Parliament had been passed for repairing and
turnpiking the road between Wednesbury and
Birmingham; but, although the turnpike gates
may have been in existence, the road itself certainly
does not seem to have been repaired, and
must have remained in the condition described
in the preamble to that Act, when it was “so
ruinous and bad that in the winter season many
parts thereof are impassable for waggons and
carriages, and very dangerous for travellers.” At
the same time, the road on the other side of
Wednesbury was “in a ruinous condition, and
in some places very narrow and incommodious”;
so it is evident that Wednesbury was in the
unenviable but by no means unique position of
being islanded amid execrable and scarcely
practicable roads.</p>

<p>In his old age Wesley occasionally made use
of coaches and chaises, which were then a great
deal better and more numerous than they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
been forty years earlier, when he commenced his
labours; but he did not give up the saddle until
very near the last. In 1779, being then in his
seventy-seventh year, he was still so active that
on one day he rode from Worcester to Brecon,
sixty miles, and preached on his arrival there.
In 1782, when eighty, he still travelled, according
to his own computation, four or five thousand
miles a year, rose early, preached, and possessed
the faculty of sleeping, night or day, whenever he
desired to do so. When he began to travel he
rose at the most astonishing hours—hours unknown
even to the early-rising, hard-riding, hard-living
travellers of that time. Let us look at his
record for February 1746, along the Great North
<span class="locked">Road:—</span></p>

<p>“<i>16th February.</i>—I rose soon after three. I
was wondering the day before at the mildness of
the weather, such as seldom attends me in my
journeys; but my wonder now ceased. The wind
was turned full north, and blew so exceeding hard
and keen that when we came (from London) to
Hatfield neither my companions nor I had much
use of our hands or feet. After resting an hour,
we bore up again through the wind and snow,
which drove full in our faces; but this was only
a squall. In Baldock field the storm began in
earnest; the large hail drove so vehemently in our
faces that we could not see, nor hardly breathe;
however, before two o’clock we reached Baldock,
where one met and conducted us safe to Potton.
About six I preached to a serious congregation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
“<i>17th.</i>—We set out as soon as it was well
light; but it was hard work to get forward, for
the frost would not well break or bear; and, the
untracked snow covering all the roads, we had
much ado to keep our horses on their feet. Meantime
the wind rose higher and higher, till it was
ready to overturn both man and beast. However,
after a short bait at Bugden, we pushed on, and
were met in the middle of an open field with so
violent a storm of rain and hail as we had not had
before; it drove through our coats, great and
small, boots, and everything, and yet froze as it
fell, even upon our eyebrows, so that we had
scarce either strength or motion left when we
came into our inn at Stilton.</p>

<p>“We now gave up our hopes of reaching
Grantham, the snow falling faster and faster.
However, we took the advantage of a fair blast
to set out, and made the best of our way to
Stamford Heath; but here a new difficulty arose
from the snow lying in large drifts. Sometimes
horse and man were a well nigh swallowed up,
yet in less than an hour we were brought safe
to Stamford. Being willing to get as far as we
could, we made but a short stop here; and about
sunset came, cold and weary, but well, to a little
town called Brig Casterton.</p>

<p>“<i>18th.</i>—Our servant came up and said, ‘Sir,
there is no travelling to-day; such a quantity of
snow has fallen in the night that the roads are
quite filled up.’ I told him, ‘At least we can
walk twenty miles a day, with our horses in our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
hands.’ So in the name of God we set out. The
north-east wind was piercing as a sword, and had
driven the snow into such uneven heaps that the
main road was not passable. However, we kept
on on foot or on horseback, till we came to the
White Lion at Grantham”—from whence Mr.
Wesley continued his journey to Epworth, his
birthplace, in Lincolnshire.</p>

<p>Wesley’s economy of time and his methods
when riding are indicated in an interesting way
in his observations on <span class="locked">horsemanship:—</span></p>

<p>“I went on slowly, through Staffordshire and
Cheshire, to Manchester. In this journey, as well
as in many others, I observed a mistake that
almost universally prevails; and I desire all
travellers to take good notice of it, which may
save them both from trouble and danger. Near
thirty years ago I was thinking, ‘How is it that
no horse ever stumbles while I am reading?’
(History, poetry, and philosophy, I commonly
read on horseback, having other employment at
other times.) No account can possibly be given
but this—because when I throw the reins on his
neck, I set myself to observe: and I aver that in
riding above a hundred thousand miles, I scarce
ever remember any horse, except two, (that would
fall head over heels any way,) to fall, or make a
considerable stumble, while I rode with a slack
rein. To fancy, therefore, that a tight rein prevents
stumbling is a capital blunder. I have
repeated the trial more frequently than most
men in the kingdom can do. A slack rein will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
prevent stumbling, if anything will, but in some
horses nothing can.”</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson’s is a figure more often associated
with coach and chaise travelling than with horsemanship,
but in his younger days he could ride
horseback with the best. He only lacked the
money to afford it. His wedding-day—when he
took the first opportunity of teaching his Tetty
marital discipline—was passed in a journey from
Derby. His wife rode one horse and he another.
“Sir,” he said, a few years later, “she had read
the old romances, and had got into her head the
fantastical notion that a woman of spirit should
use her husband like a dog. So, sir, at first she
told me that I rode too fast, and she could not
keep up with me; and when I rode a little slower
she passed me and complained that I lagged
behind. I was not to be made the slave of
caprice, and I resolved to begin as I meant to
end. I therefore pushed on briskly, till I was
fairly out of her sight. The road lay between
two hedges, so I was sure she could not miss
it; and I contrived that she should soon come
up with me. When she did, I observed her to be
in tears.”</p>

<p>It has already been noted that judges and
barristers formerly rode circuit on horseback. As
Fielding says, “a grave serjeant-at-law condescended
to amble to Westminster on an easy
pad, with his clerk kicking his heels behind
him.” In such cases, and when a lady rode
pillion behind her squire, clutching him by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
waistbelt, the “double horse” was used. This,
which was by no means a zoological freak, was
the type of horse asked for and supplied by
postmasters to two riders going in this fashion
on one animal. Like the brewers’ double stout,
the “double horse” was specially strong, and
possessed more the physique of the cart-horse
than the park hack. It was chiefly for the use of
the ladies thus riding that the “upping blocks,”
or stone steps, still occasionally seen outside old
rustic inns, were placed beside the road. They
enabled them to get comfortably seated.</p>

<p>Travellers from Scotland to London about the
middle of the eighteenth century were accustomed
to advertise for a companion. Thus, in the <i>Edinburgh
Courant</i> for January 1st, 1753, we <span class="locked">find:—</span></p>

<p>“A <span class="smcap">Gentleman</span> sets off for <span class="smcap">London</span> Tomorrow
Morning, and will either post it on horses or a
Post-Chaise, so wants a Companion. He is to be
found at the Shop of Mr. Sands, Bookseller.”</p>

<p>It was then generally found cheap, and sometimes
profitable as well, to buy a horse when
starting from Edinburgh, and to sell him on
arrival in London. Prices being higher in the
Metropolis, the canny travellers who adopted this
plan often got more for the horse than they had
given. This method had, however, the defect of
not working in reverse, and so those Scots who
returned would have had to hire at some considerable
expense, or buy dear to sell cheap, a
thing peculiarly abhorrent to the Scottish mind.
Dr. Johnson would have characteristically brushed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
this argument away by declaring that the Scot
never did return.</p>

<p>During many long years Scots travelling in
their own country followed an equally economical
plan. “The Scotch gentry,” said Thomas Kirke
in 1679, “generally travel from one friend’s house
to another; so seldom require a change-house.
Their way is to hire a horse and a man for twopence
a mile; they ride on the horse thirty or
forty miles a day, and the man who is his guide
foots it beside him, and carries his luggage to
boot.” The “change-house” was, of course, an
inn; and from this custom, when every man’s
house was an hotel, the Scottish inns long remained
very inferior places.</p>

<p>Fielding throws a very instructive light upon
the device hit upon by any two travellers who
wished to go together and yet had only one horse
between them. This was called “Ride and Tie.”
He says: “The two travellers set out together,
one on horseback, the other on foot. Now, as it
generally happens that he on horseback outgoes
him on foot, the custom is, that when he arrives
at the distance agreed on, he is to dismount, tie
the horse to some gate, tree, post, or other thing,
and then proceed on foot; when the other comes
up to the horse, he unties him, mounts, and
gallops on, till, having passed by his fellow-traveller,
he likewise arrives at the place of tying.
And this is that method of travelling so much in
use among our prudent ancestors, who knew that
horses had mouths as well as legs, and that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
could not use the latter without being at the
expense of suffering the beasts themselves to use
the former.”</p>

<p>Not until the first decade of the nineteenth
century had gone by did the horseman wholly
disappear from the road into or on to the coaches.
Let us attempt to fix the date, and put it at 1820,
when the fast coaches began to go at a pace equal
or superior to that of the saddle-horse. The
curious may even yet see the combined upping-blocks
and milestones placed for the use of horsemen
on the road across Dunsmore Heath.</p>

<p>In thus giving 1820 as the date of the horseman’s
final disappearance, it need not be supposed
that Cobbett and his <i>Rural Rides</i> are forgotten.
He covered England on horseback some years
later, but his journeys are not on all fours with
those of the horsemen whose only desire was
quickly to get from start to finish of their
journeys. He halted by the way, and from the
vantage-point of the saddle cast a keenly scrutinising
eye upon the agricultural methods of the
various districts, as seen across the tops of hedgerows,
or delayed his travels to harangue the
farmers on market-days. Nor is the existence
forgotten of those country gentlemen and City
merchants who, seventy years ago, rode to and
from the City on horseback; but they also formed
an exception. Already, by some ten years or so,
the commercial travellers, as a body, had left the
saddle and taken to what was, in its first inception,
essentially the vehicle of the commercial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
representative. This was the “gig.” The gig
at once became a favourite middle-class conveyance.
Thurtell, the flashy betting-man, vulgar
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">roué</i>, and murderer, was thought by a witness “a
respectable man: he kept a gig.” This aroused
the scorn of Carlyle, who coined the word
“gigmanity.”</p>

<p>The early commercial travellers, in fact, were
long known as “riders,” from their custom of
riding horseback from town to town, sometimes
with a led pack-horse when their samples were
unusually bulky or heavy. The “London riders”
sometimes found mentioned in old literature were
therefore London commercials. The successive
names by which these “ambassadors of commerce,”
as they have sometimes been grandiloquently
styled, were known are themselves highly illuminating.
They were, in succession, “bagmen,”
“riders,” “travellers,” and “commercial gentlemen.”
They are now “representatives.”</p>

<span class="subhead">DAWN OF THE COACHING AGE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span> the first stage-coaches had been put
upon the chief roads out of London, and had
begun to ply between the capital and the principal
towns. Stage-coaches are, on insufficient authority,
said to have begun about 1640, but no particulars
are available in support of that statement, and in
considering this point we are bound to look into
the social state of England at that time, and to
consider the likelihood or otherwise of a public
service of coaches being continued throughout
those stormy years which preceded, accompanied,
and followed the great Civil War that opened
with the raising of the King’s standard at Nottingham
in 1642, and ended with the Battle of
Naseby in June 1645. That victory ended the
war in favour of the Parliament men, but the
political troubles and their attendant social displacements
continued.</p>

<p>It has been said that hawking parties pursued
their sport between the opposed armies on Marston
Moor, and the inference has been drawn that the
nation was not disturbed to its depths by what we
are usually persuaded was a tremendous struggle
between King and Parliament. Certainly the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
Associated Counties of East Anglia were little
affected by the contest, but theirs was an exceptional
experience, brought about by that association,
entered upon for mutual protection against
either side, and to prevent the scene of warfare
being pitched within those limits. It is not likely
that any service of coaches ran in the disturbed
period, when confidence was so rudely shaken; and
it was not until the Commonwealth had been
established some years that the first coaching
advertisement of which we have any knowledge
appeared.</p>

<p>In writing thus, it is not forgotten that somewhere
about the year 1610 a foreigner from the
wilds of Pomerania obtained a Royal patent granting
him, for the term of fifteen years, the exclusive
right of running coaches or waggons between
Edinburgh and Leith. We have no details of this
purely local service, but it is to be supposed that
it was little more than a stage-waggon carrying
goods and passengers too infirm to ride horseback
between Edinburgh and its seaport. We are
equally ignorant of the length of time the service
lasted.</p>

<p>The next reference to stage-coaches is equally
detached and inconclusive. It is found in a
booklet issued by John Taylor, describing a
journey he made to the Isle of Wight in 1648.
He and his party set out on October 19th to see
the captive Charles the First, their “gracious
Soveraigne, afflicted Lord and Master,” imprisoned
at Carisbrooke Castle. They “hired the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
Southampton Coach, which comes weekly to the
Rose, near Holborn Bridge”—a statement that at
least proves the existence of a public vehicle of
sorts. But it is the first and last reference to the
Southampton Coach that has come down these two
hundred and fifty-odd years. If Taylor tells us
nothing of its history, he at least gives a description
of the journey that retains something of its
original amusing qualities, and, with the lapse of
time, becomes something of an historic <span class="locked">document:—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">

</div></div>
</div>

<p>Southampton, eighty miles from their starting-point,
was therefore a three days’ journey in the
autumn of 1648. That they were careful not to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
be on the road after dark is evident from the time
they got to Staines, the first stopping-place. The
sun sets at exactly 5 p.m. on October 19th.</p>

<p>The reference to a place called “Bawwaw,”
between Bagshot and Alton, is not to be explained
by any scrutiny of maps.</p>

<p>Thenceforward until 1657 stage-coaches are not
mentioned in the literature of the age, and we set
foot upon firm ground only with the advertisement
in the <i>Mercurius Politicus</i> of April 9th in that
<span class="locked">year:—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap"><i>“FOR the convenient accommodation of Passengers
from and betwixt the Cities of</i> London <i>and</i>
Westchester, <i>there is provided several Stage-Coaches
which go from the</i> George <i>Inn without Aldersgate
upon every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to</i>
Coventry, <i>in Two days for Twenty five shillings,
to</i> Stone <i>in Three days for Thirty shillings, and to</i>
Chester <i>in Four days for Thirty five shillings, and
from thence to return upon the same days; which is
performed with much safety to the Passengers, having
fresh Horses once a day. In Mondays Intelligence
last the severall sums and rates were by the Printer
mistaken.”</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The objective of the first stage-coach ever
established being Chester naturally provokes inquiry.
There seems to have been no other stage
upon any road in that pioneer year. The preference
for Chester argues a large traffic already
existing on that road: men riding post-horses,
women riding pillion behind friends, relatives, or
servants, or possibly in some stage-waggon whose
history has not come down to us. The coach can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
only have been established to satisfy a pre-existent
demand. The question why there should have
been more travellers on this route than any other
is answered in this being the road to Ireland
then generally followed, and Chester itself the
port of embarkation for that country. Coventry
and Stone were only served incidentally.</p>

<p>The following spring witnessed an amazing burst
of coaching activity, for the <i>Mercurius Politicus</i>
in April contained an advertisement announcing
stage-coaches on the Exeter and Great North roads,
to begin on the 26th of that month. They ran from
the “George” Inn, Aldersgate Street <span class="locked">Without:—</span></p>

<p>“On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays to
Salisbury in two days for <span class="smcap smaller">XX</span><sup><i>s</i></sup>, Blandford and

<p>Every Monday and Wednesday others were to

<p>This advertisement then concluded by inviting
passengers to another “George” <span class="locked">Inn:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
“Let them repair to the George Inn on Holborn
Bridge, and they shall be in good Coaches
with good Horses at and for reasonable rates,
to Salisbury, Blandford, Exmaster, Hunnington,
Exeter, Ockinton, Plimouth, and Cornwal.”</p>

<p>The extraordinarily misspelt names of some of
the places mentioned in these notices show how
ill-known the country then was. For “Burput”
we must read Bridport; for “Hunnington,” Honiton;
and for “Exmaster,” Axminster; “Ockinton”
is probably Okehampton.</p>

<p>At this time, and for very many years yet to
come, the stage-coaches were strictly fair-weather
services. With every recurrent spring they were
brought out from their retirement, and so early
as Michaelmas were taken off the roads and laid
up for the winter. How the pioneer coach to
Chester fared in its second season is hid from us,
but the announcement of its third year, in 1659,
is <span class="locked">instructive:—</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“These are to give notice, that from the
George Inn, without Aldersgate, goes every
Monday and Thursday a coach and four able
horses, to carry passengers to Chester in five
days, likewise to Coventry, Cosell (Coleshill),
Cank, Litchfield, Stone, or to Birmingham,
Wolverhampton, Shrewsbury, Newport, Whitchurch,
and Holywell, at reasonable rates, by us,
who have performed it two years.</p>

<p class="sigmid b1">
“<span class="smcap">William Dunstan.</span><br />

“<span class="smcap">Henry Earle.</span><br />

“<span class="smcap">William Fowler.</span>”
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
It now took a day longer to reach Chester—assuming
that the promise to perform the journey
in four days ever was kept; and it will be
observed that Birmingham, Shrewsbury, and other
places, on a different route than that through
Lichfield and Stone, are named in the manner of
an alternative. The Chester stage of this year,
in fact, varied its itinerary to suit its passengers.
The “by us, who have performed it two years,”
looks suspiciously like an opposition already
threatened; while the “four able horses” insisted
on (but not mentioned in the first announcement)
reads like an improvement upon a former team
that was not able. Those, of course, were times
before horses were generally changed on the
way, and the same long-suffering beasts that
dragged the coaches from London often brought
them to their destination. According to the first
advertisement of this Chester stage, quoted above,
this particular coach was an exception to the
usual practice, and actually had fresh horses once
a day.</p>

<p>A stage seems to have plied between London
and Oxford in 1661, but new coaches for a time
were few, and it is said that there were but six
in 1662. In the following year a coach of sorts
ran from Preston in Lancashire to London; and,
as may be gathered from a letter from Edward
Parker to his father, it was a very primitive
<span class="locked">contrivance:—</span></p>

<p>“I got to London on Saturday last; my
journey was noe way pleasant, being forced to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
ride in the boote all the waye. The company
y<sup>t</sup> came up with mee were persons of greate
qualitie, as knightes and ladyes. My journey’s
expense was 30<sup><i>s</i></sup>. This travell hath soe indisposed
mee, y<sup>t</sup> I am resolved never to ride up againe
in y<sup>e</sup> coatche. I am extremely hott and feverish.
What this may tend to I know not. I have not
as yet advised my doctor.”</p>

<p>Our natural curiosity on that head cannot
be satisfied, for the Parker correspondence ends
abruptly there; but we fear the worst. Heading
that testimony to the quality of early coach-travelling,
we may find it not altogether without
significance that from this year forward to 1667
little is heard of coaches. Perhaps those who
gave the early ones a trial were glad to get back
to their saddles and ride horseback again. However
that may be, certainly coaching history,
except by inference, is in those years a blank.
We may infer services to other towns from oblique
and scattered references, but direct information is
lacking. That a stage-coach—or possibly more
than one—was on the road between London and
Norwich in 1665 is to be gathered from the
proclamation issued in that East Anglian city
on July 20th of that terrible year of the Great
Plague, which destroyed half the population of
London: “From this daie,” ran that ordinance,
“all ye passage coaches shall be prohibited to goe
from ye city to London, and come from thence
hither, and also ye common carts and wagons.”
Already, before that notice was issued, wayfarers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
from that doomed city had been struck down by
the deadly and mysterious disease, and at Norwich
itself travellers hailing from the centre of
infection had died, swiftly and in circumstances
that struck terror into the hearts of the people.
Not that plagues were things unknown; for
Hobson, the Cambridge carrier, had died from the
vexation and enforced idleness of the Cambridge
edict of 1631, forbidding intercourse with London,
even then ravaged with an infectious disorder.</p>

<p>What were the first stage-coaches like?</p>

<p>If we are to credit Taylor’s description of
the earliest coaches, some of them must have
resembled the present Irish jaunting-car, or
Bianconi’s mid-nineteenth century coaches, in the
manner of carrying passengers. He tells us, in
his fanciful way, that a coach, “like a perpetual
cheater, wears two bootes and no spurs, sometimes
having two pairs of legs to one boote, and
oftentimes (against nature) it makes faire ladies
weare the boote; and if you note, they are carried
back to back, like people surprised by pyrats, to
be tyed in that miserable manner, and thrown
overboard into the sea. Moreover, it makes people
imitate sea-crabs, in being drawn sideways, as
they are when they sit in the boot of the coach;
and it is a dangerous kind of carriage for the
commonwealth, if it be considered.” This boot,
or this pair of boots—which did not in the least
resemble, in shape or position, the fore and hind
boots of a later age—was a method of carrying
the outsides in days before the improvement of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
roads rendered it possible for any one to ride on
the roof without incurring the danger of being
flung off. No illustration of this type of coach
has ever been found, but it seems possible that
the back-to-back boots, to carry four, were built
on to the hinder part of the coach, and really
formed the first attempt to carry outsides.</p>

<p>This type of coach described by Taylor must
have been freakish and ephemeral. Those in
general use were very different, resembling in
their construction the private carriages and
London hackney-coaches of the time, and varying
from them only in being built to hold a
number of people—usually six, but on occasion
eight. In Sir Robert Howard’s comedy, <i>The
Committee</i>, printed in 1665, the Reading coach
brings six passengers to London.</p>

<p>The body was covered with stout leather,
nailed on to the frame with broad-headed nails,
whose shining heads, gilt or silvered, picked out
the general lines of the structure, and were
considered to give a pleasing decorative effect.
Windows and doors were at first unknown. In
their stead were curtains and wooden shutters,
so that the interior of an early coach on a wet
or chilly day, when the curtains were drawn,
must have been a close and dismal place. It
was this feature that gave Taylor an opportunity
of comparing a coach with a hypocrite: “It is
a close hypocrite, for it hath a cover for knavery
and curtains to vaile and shadow any wickedness.”
The first vehicle with glass windows was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
private carriage of the Duke of York, in 1661,
and we do not begin to hear of glazed windows
in stage-coaches until the beginning of the
eighteenth century, when “glass coaches” were
announced. It is, indeed, unlikely that glass
could in any case have been introduced for the
purpose of country travelling at an earlier date,
for it would need to have been of extraordinary
strength and thickness to survive the shocks and
crashes of travel of this period.</p>

<p>All these vehicles were low hung, for the
heavy body, slung by massive leather braces
from the upright posts springing from the axletrees
of front and hind wheels, was too responsive
to any and every rut and irregularity of the road
to be placed at the height to which the coaches
of a century later attained.</p>

<p>In the excessive jolting then incidental to
travelling, the body of a coach swayed laterally
to such an extent that it would often swing, in
the manner of a pendulum, quite clear of the
underworks. Occupants of coaches were thus
often afflicted with nausea, not unlike that of
sea-sickness, and to be “coached” was at that
time an expression which meant the getting used
to a violent motion at first most emphatically
resented by the human stomach.</p>

<p>Although the body of a coach enjoyed a wide
range of motion sideways, it had not by any means
the same freedom back and forth. A severe strain,
in the continual plunging and jolting, was therefore
thrown upon the supporting uprights, so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
they not infrequently gave way under the ordeal,
and suddenly threw passengers and coachman in
one common heap of ruin. To aid him in making
such roadside repairs as these and other early defects
of construction often rendered necessary, the
coachman carried with him a box of tools placed
under his seat, and it is from this circumstance
that the name of “hammercloth”—the hangings
decorating the coachman’s seat on many a State
carriage—was derived.</p>

<p>Bad as was the situation of the passengers, that
of the coachman was infinitely worse. His was a
seat of torture, for it was placed immediately over
the front pair of wheels, and, totally unprovided
with springs, transmitted to his body the full
force of every shock with which those wheels
descended into holes or encountered stones.</p>

<p>In 1667 a London and Oxford coach is found,
performing the fifty-four miles in two days,
halting for the intervening night at Beaconsfield;
and in the same year the original Bath coach
appears, in this portentous <span class="locked">announcement:—</span></p>

<blockquote class="narrow1">
<p class="center larger">“FLYING MACHINE.</p>

<p class="hang">“All those desirous to pass from London
to Bath, or any other Place on their
Road, let them repair to the ‘Bell
Savage’ on Ludgate Hill in London,
and the ‘White Lion’ at Bath, at
both which places they may be
received in a Stage Coach every
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
which performs the Whole Journey
in Three Days (if God permit), and
sets forth at five o’clock in the
morning.</p>

<p class="hang">“Passengers to pay One Pound five
Shillings each, who are allowed to
carry fourteen Pounds Weight—for
all above to pay three-halfpence per
Pound.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This is the first appearance of the epithet
“Flying” in the literature of coaches. Possibly
it was used in this first instance in order to distinguish
the new conveyance from a stage-waggon
that must for many years before have gone the
journey, as well as to justify the higher fare
charged by the new vehicle. The waggon would
have conveyed passengers at anything from a
halfpenny to a penny a mile; by “Flying
Machine” it came to threepence. The term
“Flying,” for a coach that consumed three days
in performing a journey of 109 miles, raises a
smile; but it was only relative, and in contrast
with the pace of the waggons of that period, which
would probably have made it a six-days’ trip.</p>

<p>This Bath coach would seem to have set the
fashion in nomenclature, for in April 1669 a
“Flying Coach” began to fly between Oxford
and London. It was, it will be noticed, a
“coach,” and not a “machine”; the term
“machine” did not come into general use until
about seventy years later. But although the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
Oxford coach did not call itself by so high-sounding
a title, it made a better pace than the
Bath affair, doing the fifty-four miles in one day,
between the hours of six o’clock in the morning
and seven in the evening. Moreover, its fare—twelve
shillings, reduced two years later to ten—was
somewhat cheaper. Perhaps one was always
charged higher rates on the fashionable Bath
Road.</p>

<p>How, in this thirteen years’ interval between
1657 and 1669, had the older stages progressed?
The Chester stage was going its way, promising
to do the distance in five days, but taking six—a
sad falling off from the original four; of the
others, presumably continuing, we hear nothing
further, and of new ventures there is not a
whisper. Yet it is surely not to be supposed
that, at a time when coaches ran to Bath,
to York, to Coventry, and to Norwich, such a
place (for instance) as Bristol would be without
that convenience. For Bristol was then what
Glasgow is now—the second city. London came
first, with its half a million inhabitants; Bristol
came next, with some 28,000, and Norwich third,
with 27,000. It is, then, only fair to assume that
other coaches existed of whose story nothing has
survived. A strong reason for coming to this conclusion
is found in the publication in 1673 of
Cresset’s violent tirade against coaches, not,
surely, called forth <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">apropos</i> of the already old-established
stages, but provoked, doubtless, by
some sudden increase, of which we, at this lapse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
of time, know nothing. What brief John Cresset
could have held for the innkeepers and horse-breeders,
and for the other trades supposed to be
injuriously affected by the increase of stage-coaches,
we know not, nor, indeed, anything of
Cresset himself, except that he lived in the
Charterhouse.</p>

<p>Between London, York, Chester, and Exeter
he calculated that a total number of fifty-four
persons travelled weekly, making a grand total
for those roads of 1,872 such travellers in a year.
A brief examination of his arithmetic shows—as
we have already pointed out—that the coaches of
that age lay up for the winter months.</p>

<p>His indictment of coaches is to be found in his
<i>Grand Concern of England Explained</i>, and is
very vigorous indeed, and—as we see it nowadays—extravagantly
<span class="locked">silly:—</span></p>

<p>“Will any man keep a horse for himself and
another for his servant all the year round, for to
ride one or two journeys, that at pleasure, when he
hath occasion, can slip to any place where his
business lies for two or three shillings, if within
twenty miles of London, and so proportionately
to any part of England? No, there is no man,
unless some noble soul that seems to abhor being
confined to so ignoble, base, and sordid a way of
travelling as these coaches oblige him to, and who
prefers a public good before his own ease and
advantage, that will keep horses.”</p>

<p>According to this vehement counsel for the
suppression of stage-coaches, they brought the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
country gentlemen up to London on the slightest
pretext—sometimes to get their hair cut—-with
their wives accompanying them; and when they
were both come to town, they would “get fine
clothes, go to plays and treats, and by these means
get such a habit of idleness and love for pleasure
that they are uneasy ever after.</p>

<p>“Travelling in these coaches can neither prove
advantageous to men’s health or business, for
what advantage is it to men’s health to be called
out of their beds into their coaches an hour before
day in the morning, to be hurried in them from
place to place till one, two, or three hours within
night, insomuch that sitting all day in the summer
time stifled with heat and choked with dust, or in
the winter time starving or freezing with cold, or
choked with filthy fogs? They are often brought
to their inns by torchlight, when it is too late to sit
up to get a supper, and next morning they are
forced into the coach so early that they can get no
breakfast. What addition is this to men’s health
or business, to ride all day with strangers oftentimes
sick, or with diseased persons, or young
children crying, to whose humours they are obliged
to be subject, forced to bear with, and many times
are poisoned with their nasty scents, and crippled
by the crowd of their boxes and bundles? Is it
for a man’s health to travel with tired jades, to be
laid fast in the foul ways and forced to wade up to
the knees in mire, afterwards to sit in the cold
till teams of horses can be sent to pull the coach
out?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
Cresset was also of opinion that the greater
number of the many roadside inns would lose their
trade owing to the rapidity of coach-travelling.
Here, at least, he exceeded his brief, for coaches
by no means attained so speedy a rate of travel as
that reached by horsemen. Thoresby, ten years
later, is a case in point. He was wont to travel
horseback between Leeds and London in four days,
but when he journeyed from York to London in
the coach, no greater distance than from Leeds,
it took six days. Swift, too, in 1710, rode from
Chester to London in five days; when the degenerating
Chester stage, which had started to
perform it in 1657 in four days, had already taken
one additional day, and was about to take another.
Cresset, summing up such objectionable things as
“rotten coaches” and traces, and coachmen “surly,
dogged, and ill-natured,” advocated the total suppression
of such methods of travelling, or at least—counsels
of moderation prevailing—of most of
them. In conclusion, he proposed that coaches
should be limited to one for every county town in
England, to go backwards and forwards once a
week.</p>

<p>Unhappily for Cresset’s peace of mind, coaches
did not decay. Nor did they wilt and wither
before the onslaught of another writer, who, under
the pen-name of “A Country Tradesman,” published
a pamphlet in 1678, called <i>The Ancient
Trades Decayed, Repaired Again</i>. According to
this writer, if coaches were suppressed, more wine
and beer would be drunk at the inns, to the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
increase and advantage of the Excise; and the
breed of horses would be improved, in consequence
of the gentlemen who then rode in coaches being
obliged to return to horse-riding.</p>

<p>In 1673, in an announcement of stages to
York, Chester, and Exeter, the journey to Exeter
is put at “eight days in summer, ten in winter.”
Here was at least one coach that had already
begun to run throughout the year, but its summer
performance justified the remarks of those ancients
who, seeing the original “four-days” announcement
of 1658, had shaken their heads and suspected
it would never last.</p>

<p>The year 1678 saw a coach on the road between
the important seaport of Hull and the city of
York, probably in connection with the York stage
between that and London; but our only knowledge
of its existence at so early a date is—to put
it in rather an Irish way—a reference to its having
been taken off. Ralph Thoresby, the Yorkshire
antiquary, is our authority. In his diary he notes
that he landed at Hull in November of that year,
and that the stage-coach was already over for the
winter. This Hull and York coach we may suppose
to have been in connection with a York and London
stage already existing—that original vehicle,
started in 1658 and alluded to in 1673, which was
to perform the journey in four days, the fare 40s.
The first detailed account of the “York Old
Coach,” as it came to be known, is found in an old
advertisement broadside discovered some years
since at the back of an old drawer at the “Black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
Swan,” in York. It is dated 1706, and is evidently
an announcement of the coach resuming its season
after one of its annual <span class="locked">hibernations:—</span></p>

<p>It still took four days, as it had done when
first established close upon half a century before.
Clearly times and coaches alike moved slowly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
That York even then displayed its sub-metropolitan
character will be seen from the footnote
to the handbill, relating to the Newcastle coach.
Local services apparently radiated from the city
to Hull, Leeds, Wakefield, and other places.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, other provincial towns had not been
idle, and we must needs make a slight divergence
here to give an outline of what Glasgow was
attempting in local intercommunication. Nothing
thus early was on the road between Glasgow and
London, but strenuous efforts were made to link
Glasgow and Edinburgh (forty-four miles apart)
together by a public service so early as 1678, when
Provost Campbell and the magistrates of Glasgow
agreed with William Hoorn, of Edinburgh, for a
coach to go on that road once a week: “a sufficient
strong coach, drawn by sax able horses,
whilk coach sall contine sax persons and sall go
ance ilk week, to leave Edinburgh ilk Monday
morning, and to return again (God willing) ilk
Saturday night.” To travel those forty-four miles
was, therefore, the occupation of three days. Even
thus early we see the beginnings of that spirit of
municipal enterprise which has in modern times
carried Glasgow so far. Now the local tramway,
water, gas, and electric lighting authority, she, so
early as the seventeenth century, essayed a public
service of coaches.</p>

<p>Like much else in early coaching history, this
is merely a fragment; but again, in 1743, Glasgow
is found returning to the question, in an attempt
of the Town Council to set up a stage-coach or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
“lando,” to go once a week in winter and twice in
summer. The attempt failed, and it was not until
1749 that the first conveyance to ply regularly
between Glasgow and Edinburgh was established.
This was the “Caravan,” which made the passage
in two days each way. It was succeeded in 1759
by the “Fly,” which brought the time down to a
day and a half.</p>

<p>In 1697, according to an entry in the diary of
Sir William Dugdale, under date of July 16th, a
London and Birmingham coach, by way of Banbury,
was then running; but such isolated references
are quite obscured by the flood of light
thrown upon coaching by the work of De Laune,
<i>The Present State of London</i>, dated 1681. In
his pages is to be found a complete list of all the
stage-coaches, carriers, and waggons to and from
London in that year. The carriers and waggons
are very numerous, and there are in all
119 coaches, of which number between sixty
and seventy are long-distance conveyances, the
remainder serving places up to twenty or
twenty-five miles from London. In that list we
find that, although a marvellous expansion of
coaching had taken place, some of the places
already catered for in 1658 are abandoned. The
Edinburgh stage does not appear, and nothing is
to be found on that road farther north than York.
The reason for the omission was, doubtless, that
York, then relatively a more important place than
now, had its own well-organised coaching businesses.
Travellers from London for Edinburgh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
would secure a place to York, and, arriving there,
book again by a York and Edinburgh coach. The
Edinburgh stage from London, once a fortnight,
is, indeed, not heard of again until 1734.</p>

<p>Many of the coaches mentioned by De Laune
went twice and thrice a week, and a large proportion
of those to places not beyond twenty or
twenty-five miles from London made double
journeys in the day. Thus Windsor had no fewer
than seven coaches, six of them in and out daily.
The age, it will be conceded, was not without
enterprise. But the omissions are striking;
Okehampton, Plymouth, and Cornwall, included
in the purview of the pioneers of 1658,
are not mentioned. Liverpool, Sheffield, Newcastle,
Leicester, Hereford and others were
outside their activities. No one, it seemed, wanted
to go to Glasgow; Manchester men were content
to ride horseback; Leeds, now numbering some
430,000 inhabitants, and increasing by 2,000 a
year, was a town of only 7,000, and the clothiers
rode to York and caught the London coach there.
To Bath and Bristol, however, there were five
coaches; to Exeter, four; to Guildford, three;
to Cambridge, Braintree, Canterbury, Chelmsford,
Gloucester, Lincoln and Stamford, Norwich, Oxford,
Portsmouth, Reading, Saffron Walden, and
Ware, two each.</p>

<p>Despite the four coaches between Exeter and
London mentioned by De Laune in 1681, the
Mayor of Lyme Regis, having in October 1684
urgent official business in London, is found, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
company with one servant, hiring post-horses from
Lyme to Salisbury. It is quite clear that if there
had been a coach serving at the time, he would
have caught it at Charmouth, a mile and a half
from that little seaport; but there was, for some
unexplained reason, a break in the service, and it
was not until Salisbury was reached, sixty miles
along the road, that he found a stage. The coach
fare from Salisbury to London for self and servant
was 30<i>s.</i>, and he spent, “at several stages, to
gratify coachmen,” 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>With the existence of such a volume of trade
as that disclosed by De Laune, it is not surprising
to find that the scolding voices of opponents to
coaching had by this time died down to a mere
echo. Instead of reviling coaches, the writers of
the age extolled their use and convenience. Thus
Chamberlayne, in the 1684 edition of his <i>Present
State of Great Britain</i>, the <i>Whitaker’s Almanack</i>
of that period, says: “There is of late
such an admirable commodiousness for both men
and women to travel from London to the principal
towns in the country, that the like hath not been
known in the world; and that is by stage-coaches,
wherein any one may be transported to any place,
sheltered from foul weather and foul ways, free
from endamaging of one’s health and one’s body
by hard jogging or over-violent motion, and this
not only at the low price of about a shilling for
every five miles, but with such velocity and speed
in one hour as that the post in some foreign
countries cannot make but in one day.” Those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
foreign countries have our respectful sympathy,
for Chamberlayne in thus extolling our superiority
was singing the praises of four miles an hour!</p>

<p>From the limbo of half-forgotten things we
drag occasional references to coaches towards the
close of the seventeenth century. In April 1694
a London and Warwick stage was announced to
go every Monday, to make the journey in two
days, “performed (if God permit) by Nicholas
Rothwell”; and in 1696 the “Confatharrat”
coach was already spoken of as a familiar object
on the London and Norwich road. All we know
of the “Confatharrat” is that it came to the
“Four Swans,” in Bishopsgate Street Within. Its
curious name is probably the seventeenth-century
spelling of the word “confederate,” and the coach
itself was, no doubt, run by an association, or “confederacy,”
of owners and innkeepers, in succession
to some unlucky person who singly had attempted
it and failed.</p>

<p>On some roads enterprise slackened. Thus, in
1700, the “Fly” coach to Exeter slept the <em>fifth</em>
night from London at Axminster, where the next
morning a woman “shaved the coach,” and on the
afternoon of the sixth day it crawled into Exeter.
Forty-three years earlier it had taken only four
days.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p>OLD BIRMINGHAM COACHING BILL.</p></div></div>

<p>Nicholas Rothwell, of the London and Warwick
stage in 1694, reappears in an extremely
interesting broadsheet advertisement of 1731,
announcing that the “Birmingham stage-coach in
two days and a half begins, May the 24th.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
Although we have no earlier information of this
coach, it is probably safe to assume that this, like
the advertisement of the York coach already
quoted, merely advertised the beginning of a new
season, and that winter was still largely, as it had
been seventy-six years before, a blank in the
coaching world. Rothwell was evidently established
at Warwick, and seems to have been the
first notable coach-proprietor, the forerunner of
the Chaplins, Nelsons, Mountains, Shermans and
Ibbersons of a later age. By his old advertisement
we see that he catered for all classes of
travellers—by stage-coach, private carriage, chaise,
and waggon—and that he hired out horses to the
gentlemen who still preferred their own company
and the saddle to the coach and its miscellaneous
strangers. Even the dead were not beyond the
consideration of Mr. Rothwell, whose “Hearse,
with Mourning Coach and Able Horses,” is set
forth to “go to any part of Great Britain, at
reasonable Rates.” Unhappily for the historian
eager to reconstruct the road life of those times,
this old advertisement is almost all that survives
to tell us of Rothwell, and fortunate we are to
have even that, for such sheets, as commonplace
when issued as the advertisements of railway
excursions are at the present time, are now of
extreme rarity. It would appear, from the rude
woodcut illustrating Rothwell’s bill, that his
coach was of the old type, hung on leather straps
and quite innocent of springs—the kind of coach
that Parson Adams, in Fielding’s <i>Joseph Andrews</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
outwalked without the slightest difficulty. It
seems to be more up-to-date in the matter of
windows, and to be a “glass-coach,” if we may
judge by the appearance of the window at which
the solitary and unhappy-looking passenger is
standing in an attitude suggestive of stomachic
disturbance. There are no windows in the upper
quarters of the coach, which in that and some
other respects greatly resembles the vehicle pictured
in 1747 by Hogarth in his <i>Inn Yard</i>.</p>

  <div class="caption vtight"><p><span class="in4">THE STAGE-COACH, 1783.</span>
  <span class="fright"><i>After Rowlandson.</i></span></p></div></div>

<p>Rothwell’s coach is drawn by four horses in
hand, with a postilion on the off horse of a couple
of extra leaders. The practice of using six horses
and a postilion is one to which we find allusion
in Fielding’s <i>Joseph Andrews</i>, written nine years
later than the date of this Birmingham coach.
The curious will find the description in the twelfth
chapter of that novel, where Joseph, recovering
from the murderous attack of two highwaymen,
attracts the attention of the postilion of a passing
stage-coach. “The postilion, hearing a man’s
groans, stopped his horses, and told the coachman
he was certain there was a dead man lying in the
ditch, for he heard him groan.” (That postilion
surely was an Irishman.) “‘Go on, sirrah!’ says
the coachman: ‘we are confounded late, and have
no time to look after dead men.’ A lady, who
heard what the postilion said, and likewise heard
the groan, called eagerly to the coachman to stop
and see what was the matter. Upon which, he bid
the postilion alight and look into the ditch. He
did so, and returned, ‘That there was a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
sitting upright, as naked as ever he was born.’
‘O J—sus!’ cried the lady; ‘a naked man!
Dear coachman, drive on and leave him!’”</p>

<p>Rowlandson shows that in 1783 six horses were
still used, and that a postilion continued to ride
one of the leaders. It was about this same period
that the generally misquoted remark about the
ease of driving a coach-and-six through an Act of
Parliament grew proverbial. It had originated so
early as 1689, when Sir Stephen Rice, Chief Baron
of the Irish Exchequer and a bigoted Papist,
declared for James the Second, and was often
heard to say he would drive a coach and six horses
through the Act of Settlement. Later generations,
knowing nothing of six horses to a coach, and
unused to seeing more than four, unconsciously
adapted the saying to the practice of their own
times.</p>

<span class="subhead">GROWTH OF COACHING IN THE EIGHTEENTH
CENTURY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">All</span> this while the stages had gone their journeys
with the same horses from end to end, and travel
was necessarily slow. To the superficial glance it
would seem that neither the dictates of humanity
towards animals nor even the faintest glimmering
perception of the possibilities of speed in constant
relays had then dawned upon coach-proprietors; but
it would be too gross an error to convict a whole
class of stupidity so dense and brutal. It is not to
be supposed that, at a time when ten-mile relays
of saddle-horses for gentlemen riding post were
common throughout the kingdom, the advantages
of frequent changes and fresh animals were hidden
from men whose daily business it was to do with
coaches and horses. The real reasons for the bad old
practice were many. They lay in the uncertainty of
passengers, in the extreme difficulty of arranging for
changes at known places of call, and, above all, in
the impossibility of those coaches changing whose
route between given starting-point and destination
was altered to suit the convenience of travellers.</p>

<p>The first hint of quicker travel and of a better
age for horses is obtained in this advertisement of
the Newcastle “Flying Coach,” May 9th, 1734:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
“A coach will set out towards the end of next
week for London, or any place on the road. To be
performed in nine days, being three days sooner
than any other coach that travels the road: for
which purpose eight stout horses are stationed at
proper distances.”</p>

<p>This, we may take it, was a rival of the old
once-a-fortnight London and Edinburgh stage,
travelling those 396 miles in fourteen days, and,
as we infer from above, reaching Newcastle in
twelve. At the same time John Dale came forward
with a statement that a coach would take
the road from Edinburgh for London, “towards
the end of each week,” also in nine days; so that
rivalries evidently existed on the great road to the
north at that period. No conceivable change can
satisfy everyone, and these accelerated services
alarmed the innkeepers, who thought they saw
their business of lodging and entertaining travellers
thus doomed to decay. It was obvious that when
the Edinburgh stage travelled an average of forty-four
miles a day instead of a mere twenty-eight or
twenty-nine, and lay on the road only eight nights
instead of thirteen, innkeepers on that route must
have lost much custom in the course of the year.
Other innkeepers on other roads gloomily heard of
these improvements, thought the times moved a
great deal too rapidly, and talked of the good old
days when travelling was safe and respectable, and
an honest licensed victualler could earn a living.
All these good folks were, no doubt, greatly relieved
when this sudden burst of coaching enterprise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
died away, as it presently did, either because
the proprietors had undertaken to perform more
than they could do, or possibly for the reason that
they had come to an agreement not to force the
pace or cut the fares. Such rivalries and such
subsequent agreements were in after years the
merest commonplaces of coaching history, and if
we seek them here we shall probably be by way
of explaining the falling-off that left its traces
twenty and thirty years later in the following
<span class="locked">announcement:—</span></p>

<p>COACHING ADVERTISEMENT FROM THE <i>EDINBURGH
COURANT</i>, 1754.</p></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
It is noteworthy that the Sunday was still
kept in this year of 1754 as a day of rest. The
reference to fares, in the lack of antecedent information,
leaves us in ignorance of what the
passengers who paid “as usual” really did pay,
but it seems that the coach itself was in that year
something new and wonderful—a great improvement
on what had gone before. The old conveyance,
hung on leather straps and with unglazed
windows, was discarded, and we have a “glass
coach-machine,” on steel springs, and with two
ends, whatever they may have been. Also, the
coach ran winter and summer. The rough woodcut
accompanying this advertisement in the
<i>Edinburgh Courant</i> for March 4th, 1754, and
subsequent dates, shows us rather a coach built
on the lines of the gentleman’s private carriage of
that age than a stage-coach. The boasted springs
are duly indicated. The driver has four horses in
hand, while a postilion, with a face like an agonised
turnip, has a couple of leaders.</p>

<p>So much for 1754 on the Great North Road;
but 1763 showed that retrogression was still the
note of the time in that quarter, for the Edinburgh
stage set out only once a month, and only when
the weather was favourable did it get to its
destination in less than a fortnight.</p>

<p>A feeble effort made about 1739 to expedite
travelling on the Exeter Road seems also to
have done little. The Exeter “Flying Stage” of
that year, purporting to inform the journey in
three days, generally took six. In 1752 it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
announced that the “‘Exeter Fast Coach,’ for
the better conveyance of travellers, starts every
Monday from the ‘Saracen’s Head,’ Skinner Street,
Snow Hill.” This also, although it promised to
get to Exeter in three days and a half, usually
took six days in winter.</p>

<p>Its programme was thus set <span class="locked">out:—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Monday.</span>—Dines at Egham; lies at Murrell’s
Green.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tuesday.</span>—Dines at Sutton; lies at the “Plume
of Feathers,” in Salisbury.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wednesday.</span>—Dines at Blandford; lies at the
“King’s Arms,” in Dorchester.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thursday.</span>—At one o’clock, Exeter.</p></blockquote>

<p>It carried six inside, but no outsides.</p>

<p>But let us be just to the coach-proprietors
whose fate it was to work the Exeter Road at that
time. In that very year a correspondent wrote to
the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> pointing out the dreadful
character of that road. “After the first forty-seven
miles from London,” he said, “you never
set eye on a turnpike.” There were turnpikes,
and, by consequence, well-kept roads, on the way
to Bath, and he declared that every one who knew
anything at all about road-travelling went to
Exeter by way of Bath. As for the country along
the Exeter Road, it was reputed to be picturesque,
but the state of the road forbade any one making
its acquaintance. “Dorchester is to us a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">terra
incognita</i>, and the map-makers might, if they
pleased, fill the vacuities of Devon and Cornwall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
with forests, sands, elephants, savages, or what
they please.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, manufacturing England was coming
into existence, and the growing necessities of trade
had brought about an increase of coaches in other
directions. Thus Birmingham, whose first direct
communication with London has already been
shown in existence in 1679, and again in 1731,
had set up a “Flying Coach” in 1742, followed in
1758 by an “Improved Birmingham Coach,” with
the legend “Friction Annihilated” prominent on
the axle-boxes. This the <i>Annual Register</i> declared
to be “perhaps the most useful invention in
mechanics this age has produced.” Much virtue
lingered in that “perhaps,” for nothing more was
heard of that wonderful device.</p>

<p>It was not until 1754 that Manchester and
London were in direct communication. The desire
of the provinces to get into touch with the metropolis
has always been greater than that of London
to commune with the country towns, and thus we
see that it was an association of Manchester men
who set up the “Flying Coach,” just as the
citizens of Oxford and the good folks of Shrewsbury’s
desire to travel to London established conveyances
for that purpose, and just as that early
railway, the London and Birmingham, was projected
and financed at Birmingham, and should,
strictly speaking, have been inversely named. But
hear what the Manchester men of 1754 <span class="locked">said:—</span></p>

<p>“However incredible it may appear, this coach
will actually (barring accidents) arrive in London<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
in four days and a half after leaving Manchester.”
The distance, it may be remarked, was
182 miles.</p>

<p>The ancient rivalry of Manchester and Liverpool
was roused by this, and four years later the
Liverpool “Flying Machine” was established, to
travel the 206½ miles between Liverpool and
London in three days. The fare, at £2 2<i>s.</i>, thus
represents about 2½<i>d.</i> a mile. This was followed
by the Leeds “Flying Coach” of 1760, advertised
to do the 190 miles in three days, by Barnsley,
Wakefield, and Sheffield, but actually taking
four.</p>

<p>Another great centre of coaching activity at
this was Shrewsbury. Those who know
that grand old town, seated majestically on its
encircling Severn, that girdles the ancient blood-red
walls with a flow as yellow as that of the
Tiber, will have observed an ancient metropolitan
air, an atmosphere of olden self-sufficiency, subtly
characterising the place. It is complete in itself:
within the double ceinture of river and hoary
defensive walls it comprises something typical of
each separate estate of the realm. The monarch
and the governing idea are represented within that
compass by the Castle and by the Council House,
and all around are still to be seen the town houses
of the old nobility and county families, neighboured
by prosperous shops and smaller residences.
Shrewsbury, like York and Edinburgh, is in fact
an ancient seat of government, delegated directly
from the Crown, once as vitally viceregal as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
Viceroyalty of India is now and much more so
than that of Ireland for long years past has been.
Shrewsbury remained the capital of the Marches
of Wales until 1689, and the history of the Council
that thence ruled the border-lands is still singularly
fresh. Nor did it lose its importance even with
the abolition of that body; for, more than elsewhere,
the town, until the railways came—suddenly
breaking up the old order and centralising everything
in London—was a centre of social life for
wide surrounding districts. The titled and gentle
families of Shropshire, Herefordshire and North
Wales who had resorted to the old Court of the
Marches continued to adorn Shrewsbury, which
had its own fashionable season and its own self-contained
interests. The whole social movement
of those surrounding districts was centred here,
and at a time when the great manufacturing
future of England had not dawned, creating vastly
populated cities and towns, Shrewsbury was not
rivalled as a coaching centre even by Bath. A
Shrewsbury coach was in existence in 1681, but
the roads between the Salopian capital and London
proved too bad, and it did not last long, nor was
it succeeded by any other coach until the spring
of 1753. Stage-waggons were on the road in the
interval between 1737 and that date, but they did
not fit the requirements of the gentlefolk, who,
when they did not ride horseback or drive in their
own chariots to London, posted across country to
Ivetsey Bank, where they caught the Chester and
London stage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
With 1753 the continuous coaching history
of Shrewsbury begins, in the starting of the
“Birmingham and Shrewsbury Long Coach,”
which journeyed to London in four days, by
the efforts of six horses. The distance was 152
miles, the fare 18s. The “Long Coach” was a
type of vehicle intermediate between the “Caravan”
of 1750<a id="FNanchor_C" href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">C</a> and the “Machine,” established
in April 1764. It was a cheap method of conveyance,
one remove above the common stage-waggons.
It set out once a week, and seems to
have been so immediately successful that a rival
and somewhat higher-class vehicle was put on the
road as soon as the coachmakers could build it.
It was in the June of that same year that
the rival—“Fowler’s Shrewsbury Stage-coach”
was the name of it—began to ply to and from
London in three and a half days; fare, one guinea
inside, outside half a guinea. Thus they continued
to run for thirteen years, without the
intrusion of a third competitor. We are not
told how these outsides were carried. Probably
they were obliged to cling to the sloping roof,
on which the athletic and adventurous found a
fearful joy with every roll and lurch, while those
who were neither agile nor imbued with the spirit
of adventure grew grey with apprehension. Indeed,
it was probably the freak of some wild spirit—perhaps
a sailor or a drunken soldier—in
seating himself on the roof that first gave coach-proprietors
the idea that roofs might be used to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
carry outsides as well as to shelter the august
occupants of the interior. We may be allowed
to imagine the arrival of the coach that first
carried these freakish persons on that dangerous
eminence, and to picture the joy of the proprietor,
who thereupon determined that, as these pioneers
for the fun of it had arrived safely, there must
be a commercial value in places on the roof. The
thing was done. Three outsides sat on the front
part, with their feet on the back of the driving-box,
while one had a place on the box-seat with
the driver, and room was left for three more on
the hind, and most inconvenient, part of the roof,
where, like Noah’s dove, they found no rest for
the soles of their feet, and had the greatest difficulty
in maintaining their position.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_C" href="#FNanchor_C" class="fnanchor">C</a> P. 119.</p></div>

<p>If the “outsides” on Fowler’s Shrewsbury
stage of 1753 were not carried on the roof, they
must have been carried in “the basket”; but as
stage-coaches provided with this species of accommodation
were generally stated in their advertisements
to have “a conveniency behind,” and the
advertisement of this makes no such claim, we are
free to assume that the roof was their portion.
The “basket” was, however, already a well-established
affair. It was a great wickerwork
structure, hung on the back of the coach between
the hind wheels by stout leather straps, and
rested on the axletree. Originally intended to
convey the luggage, it was found capable of
holding passengers, who suffered much in it in
order to ride cheaply. In the racy, descriptive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
language of the time, this “conveniency” was
known much more aptly as the “rumble-tumble.”
In this “rumble-tumble,” then, the second-class
passengers sat, up to their knees in straw. The
more straw the better the travelling, for although
the body of the coach had by this time been eased
with springs, the basket was not provided with
any such luxury, and anything in the nature of
padding would have been welcome. Already, in
1747, Hogarth had pictured an inn yard with a
coach preparing to start, and had shown a basket
fully occupied, and two outsides above.</p>

<p>The coaches were by now hung much higher,
and the original driver’s seat had given place to a
lofty box, from which the coachman had a greater
command over his horses.</p>

<p>The general appearance of stage-coaches at
this time has been eloquently described by Sir
Walter Scott. They were covered with dull black
leather, thickly studded with broad-headed nails,
tracing out the panels. The heavy window-frames
were painted red, and the windows themselves
provided with green stuff or leather curtains
which could be drawn at will. On the panels
of the body were displayed in large characters
the names of the places whence the coach started
and whither it went. The coachman and guard
(when there was a guard at all) sat in front upon
a high narrow boot, often garnished with a spreading
hammer-cloth with a deep fringe. The roof
rose in a high curve. The wheels were large,
massive, ill formed, and generally painted red.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
In shape the body varied. Sometimes it resembled
a distiller’s vat somewhat flattened, and hung
equally balanced between the immense back and
front springs; in other cases it took the form of
a violoncello case, which was, past all comparison,
the most fashionable form; again, it hung in
a more genteel posture, inclining on the back
springs, in that case giving those who sat within
the appearance of a stiff Guy Fawkes. The foremost
horse was still ridden by a postilion, a longlegged
elf dressed in a long green and gold riding-coat
and wearing a cocked hat; and the traces
were so long that it was with no little difficulty
the poor animals dragged their unwieldy burden
along. It groaned, creaked, and lumbered at
every fresh tug they gave it, as a ship, beating
up through a heavy sea, strains all her timbers.</p>

<p>In 1774 the proprietors of the “Original London
and Salop Machine, in the modern taste, on steel
springs,” announced that, among other improvements,
their coach had “bows on the top.” Some
consideration of this portentous improvement
inclines us to the belief that these “bows” must
have been guard-irons on the roof for passengers
to hold on by, and to prevent them being thrown
off. A little further consideration will perhaps
bring us to the conclusion that those “bows”
would not even then have been placed there had
not some serious accident already happened.
Such protection was not uncommon, as may be
gathered from an account of a coach journey
written by Charles H. Moritz, a worthy German<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
pastor who visited England in 1782. His narrative
shows that those who were obliged to ride
cheaply had a choice of the basket and the roof,
and that although the roof then had no seats, it
was provided with little handles, to hold on by.
But they were of little use, and when the coach
rolled like a ship upon a stormy sea the chances of
being flung overboard were still as many as ever.
But he, like others, having tried both basket and
roof, preferred the latter, and returned to it,
groaning with the shocks received in the “rumble-tumble.”</p>

<p>Rowlandson’s picture of a stage-coach in 1780
shows the same preference. Only one passenger
is seen in the wickerwork appendage, while the
roof, innocent of safeguards or seats, is covered
with sprawling passengers who are content to take
their chance of an involuntary flight, so that
they escape the certain inconveniences of the
“conveniency.”</p>

<p>“I observe,” says Moritz, “that they have
here a curious way of riding, not in, but upon, a
stage-coach. Persons to whom it is not convenient
to pay a full price, instead of the inside, sit on the
top of the coach, without any seats or even a rail.
By what means passengers thus fasten themselves
securely on the roof of these vehicles I know
not; but you constantly see numbers seated there,
apparently at their ease and in perfect safety.
This they call riding on the outside, for which
they pay only half as much as those who are
within.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
“Being obliged to bestir myself to get back to
London, as the time drew near when the Hamburg
captain with whom I intended to return had fixed
his departure, I determined to take a place as far
as Northampton on the outside. But this ride
from Leicester to Northampton I shall remember
as long as I live.</p>

<p>“The coach drove from the yard through a part
of the house. The inside passengers got in from
the yard, but we on the outside were obliged to
clamber up in the street, because we should have
had no room for our heads to pass under the gateway.
My companions on the top of the coach
were a farmer, a young man very decently dressed,
and a blackamoor. The getting up alone was at
the risk of one’s life, and when I was up I was
obliged to sit just at the corner of the coach, with
nothing to hold on by but a sort of little handle
fastened on the side. I sat nearest the wheel, and
the moment that we set off I fancied I saw certain
death before me. All I could do was to take still
tighter hold of the handle, and to be strictly
careful to preserve my balance. The machine
rolled along with prodigious rapidity over the
stones through the town of Leicester, and every
moment we seemed to fly into the air, so much so
that it appeared to me a complete miracle that we
stuck to the coach at all. But we were completely
on the wing as often as we passed through
a village or went down a hill.</p>

<p>“This continual fear of death at last became
insupportable to me, and therefore, no sooner were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
we crawling up a rather steep hill, and consequently
proceeding slower than usual, than I carefully
crept from the top of the coach, and was lucky
enough to get myself snugly ensconced in the
basket behind. ‘O sir, you will be shaken to
death!’ said the blackamoor; but I heeded him
not, trusting that he was exaggerating the unpleasantness
of my new situation. And, truly, as
long as we went on slowly up the hill, it was easy
and pleasant enough; and I was just on the point
of falling asleep, having had no rest the night
before, when on a sudden the coach proceeded at
a rapid rate downhill. Then all the boxes, iron-nailed
and copper-fastened, began, as it were, to
dance around me; everything in the basket appeared
to be alive, and every moment I received
such violent blows that I thought my last hour
had come. The blackamoor had been right, I now
saw clearly; but repentance was useless, and I
was obliged to suffer horrible torture for nearly an
hour, which seemed to me an eternity. At last we
came to another hill, when, quite shaken to pieces,
bleeding, and sore, I ruefully crept back to the
top of the coach to my former seat. ‘Ah, did I
not tell you that you would be shaken to death?’
inquired the black man, when I was creeping
along on my stomach. But I gave him no reply.
Indeed, I was ashamed; and I now write this as
a warning to all strangers who are inclined to ride
in English stage-coaches and take an outside seat,
or, worse still, horror of horrors, a seat in the
basket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
“From Harborough to Northampton I had a
most dreadful journey. It rained incessantly, and
as before we had been covered with dust, so now
we were soaked with rain. My neighbour, the
young man who sat next me in the middle, every
now and then fell asleep; and when in this state
he perpetually bolted and rolled against me with
the whole weight of his body, more than once
nearly pushing me from my seat, to which I clung
with the last strength of despair. My forces were
nearly giving way, when at last, happily, we
reached Northampton, on the evening of July 14th,
1782, an ever-memorable day to me.</p>

<p>“On the next morning I took an inside place
for London. We started early. The journey from
Northampton to the metropolis, however, I can
scarcely call a ride, for it was a perpetual motion,
or endless jolt from one place to another, in
a close wooden box, over what appeared to be
a heap of unhewn stones and trunks of trees
scattered by a hurricane. To make my happiness
complete, I had three travelling companions, all
farmers, who slept so soundly that even the
hearty knocks with which they hammered their
heads against each other and against mine did
not awake them. Their faces, bloated and discoloured
by ale and brandy and the knocks
aforesaid, looked, as they lay before me, like so
many lumps of dead flesh. I looked, and certainly
felt, like a crazy fool when we arrived at London
in the afternoon.”</p>

<span class="subhead">THE STAGE-WAGGONS AND WHAT THEY CARRIED:
HOW THE POOR TRAVELLED</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">We</span> have now arrived at the time when the goods
traffic became a prominent feature of the road.</p>

<p>The precursor of all public vehicles was the
carrier’s waggon, a conveyance of hoary antiquity,
intended in the first instance for the carriage of
heavy goods, but finding room for those wayfarers
who were too poor to own or hire a horse, or
possibly too infirm to sit one even if their means
sufficed. At least a hundred and fifty years before
the earliest stage-coach was put on the road, the
waggon, the poor man’s coach, was creaking and
groaning on its tedious way at a pace of little
more than two miles an hour. The stage-waggon,
in fact, came into use about 1500, and the first
glimpse and earliest notice of the carrier’s and
stage-waggon business introduces us to a very
celebrated waggoner indeed, by far the most
notable of all his kind—none other, in fact, than
Thomas Hobson, the carrier between Cambridge
and London, the grand original of the Chaplin &amp;
Hornes, the Pickfords, the Carter Patersons, and
Suttons of succeeding generations. Hobson’s
London place of call was the “Bull,” Bishopsgate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
Street Within. When the business was founded
is not on record, but it was old-established and
prosperous when he succeeded to it on the death
of his father in 1568. Under the terms of his
father’s will he inherited, among other things,
the vehicle with which the carrying trade was
conducted, the “cart and eight horses, and all the
harness and other things thereunto belonging,
with the nag.” It is quite evident from this that
one cart or waggon sufficed for all the commerce
between London and Cambridge at that time. If
he did not choose to take these things, he was to
have £30 instead, the equivalent of their value,
which—taking into consideration the fact that the
purchasing power of money at that time would be
about six times that of our own—was therefore
£180. The “nag” specified in the will was, of
course, the horse ridden by the waggoner by the
side of the eight-horse waggon team. In old prints
of stage-waggons we see that the waggoner did not
usually drive his team from the waggon holding
the reins, but rode a pony, and, wielding a whip
of formidable length, urged on the much-suffering
beasts through mud and ruts.</p>

<p>Hobson senior had been a man of wealth and
consideration, and his son increased both. In his
father’s lifetime he had gone continually back and
forth with the waggon, and so continued to go until
his death, January 1st, 1631, in his eighty-sixth
year. He was, as his father had been before him,
not merely a carrier between Cambridge and
London, but the only one, and specially licensed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
by the University. He conveyed the letters, too,
and had a very lucrative business of letting out
saddle-horses. In those days, before coaches had
come into existence, and when able-bodied men,
despising the slow progress of the waggon, rode
horseback, his stable of forty horses, “fit for
travelling, with boots, bridle, and whip, to furnish
the gentlemen at once, without going from college
to college to borrow,” was in great request. From
his determination to allow no picking and choosing,
and his refusing to allow any horse to be
taken out of its proper turn, first arose that
immortal proverb, “Hobson’s Choice, that or
none”—in other words, no choice whatever.
University witlings made great play with Hobson,
and when at last he died, quite a sheaf of lyrical
epitaphs on him appeared, from the well-known
ones by Milton to the more obscure exercises of
anonymous versifiers.<a id="FNanchor_D" href="#Footnote_D" class="fnanchor">D</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_D" href="#FNanchor_D" class="fnanchor">D</a> For a detailed notice of Hobson, with a portrait of him,
see the <i>Cambridge, Ely, and King’s Lynn Road</i>, pp. 10–12, 32,
140, 157–166.</p></div>

<p>The business of stage-waggoning obtained its
first specific notice so late as 1617, when Fynes
Morison, in his <i>Itinerary</i>, mentioned the “carryers,
who have long covered waggons, in which they
carry passengers from place to place; but this
kind of journey is so tedious by reason they must
take waggon very early and come very late to
their innes, that none but women and people of
inferior condition travel in this sort.”</p>

<p>How early they were accustomed to start, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
how late would come to their inns, may be gathered
from the great classic instance in Shakespeare,
where the two carriers in the First Part of <i>King
Henry the Fourth</i> are discovered in the innyard at
Rochester preparing to set forth for London. It
is two o’clock in the morning, and London but
thirty miles away, yet it will not be earlier than
“time to go to bed with a candle” before that
gammon of bacon and those two razes of ginger
are delivered at Charing Cross.</p>

<p>Shakespeare, of course, here wrote, not of the
manners and customs of Henry the Fourth’s time,
but of what he had himself heard and seen, and
what might so be seen and heard on any day, early
in the morning, in the yard of any considerable
hostelry in the kingdom. He has fixed for ever, in
his deathless pages, the road life that existed when
the sixteenth century was drawing to its close.</p>

<p>Contemporary with, but originating even
earlier than, the stage-waggons were the pack-horses,
which dated from a time when even the
broad-wheeled wains would have sunk hopelessly
in the mud of the best roads in the country. By
pack-horse, at an earlier date than 1500, all goods,
and even such heavy articles as building-stone,
coals and timber, were carried, for the very
eloquent reason that, before the passing of the
first General Highway Act, in 1555, which was
the first obligation upon the parishes to repair and
maintain the roads, nothing had been done to keep
them in repair for many centuries; and the
parishes, with the best will in the world, could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
not at once retrieve them from their desperate
condition. Wheeled traffic had been unknown
until the early stage-waggons appeared, and those
few who travelled otherwise than afoot or on
their own horses were content to mount the pack-saddle
of a patient and long-suffering pack-horse,
themselves only a degree less long-suffering
and patient. Then the etymology of the words
“travel” and “journey” was abundantly justified;
for it was sorrow and hard labour to leave
one’s own fireside, and a day’s journey was—what
the word “journey” implies—the passing from
place to place within the hours of daylight. No
one dared travel the roads when night had fallen,
and it was not until the eighteenth century had
dawned that coaches began to run by night as
well as day.</p>

<p>In far parts of the country and on the by-roads
the pack-horse train lasted an incredible time.
Wheeled conveyances of any kind were, generally
speaking, impossible on any but the principal
roads. The farmers and higglers who had occasion
to transport heavier loads than it was possible
for horses to carry, used a primitive kind of sledge,
formed of tree-trunks, of which the light tapering
ends formed the shafts and the heavy bodies of the
trunks the runners. Thus the building materials
were of old often carried or dragged, with much
friction and waste of effort, to their destination.
In Devon and Cornwall these truly savage makeshifts
were called by the peculiarly descriptive
name of “truckamucks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
When Smollett, the novelist, travelled from
Glasgow to Edinburgh and on to London as a
young man, in 1739, he rode pack-horse as far as
Newcastle, for the simple reason that between
Glasgow and the Tyne there was neither coach,
cart, nor waggon on the road; and in Yorkshire,
Cumberland, Devon and Cornwall, and the like
extreme corners of the land, where remoteness
from the world and the rugged nature of the
country conspired to exclude wheels, the packman
and his small but sturdy breed of laden horses
alone kept the rural districts supplied with their
barest requirements until the first years of the
nineteenth century were come. The old packmen’s
and drovers’ ways, narrow and winding to
avoid the turnpike-gates that once took toll of all
but the foot-passenger, may still be traced on the
Yorkshire wolds, along the shoulders of the Westmorland
and Cumberland fells, and by the rivers
and moors of Devon and Cornwall. Often they
are not even lanes, but only precipitous and rocky
tracks, eloquent of those old times that are commonly
pictured so rosy, but were really very grey
and dour. Here and there the sign of the “Pack
Horse” still survives, and marks the old houses of
entertainment once frequented by the packmen of
that vanished past. The “Pack Horse” at Chippenham
and those two old houses at Turnham
Green, the “Old Pack Horse” and the “Pack
Horse and Talbot” were halting-places of the
packmen who travelled the Bath Road. The last-named
house is now little more than an ordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
London “public,” but it still displays a picture-sign,
copied from an old original, showing a
pack-horse with a talbot by his side; the “talbot”
being the old English hound, something between
a foxhound and a bloodhound, a fierce creature
who guarded his master’s property from the
thieves and dangers of all kinds that then befell
so constantly along the roads, or even at the often
ill-famed inns by the wayside.</p>

<p>An attempt to supplant the pack-horses between
London and Shrewsbury was made in 1737, by the
establishment of the “Gee-ho.” Facts relating to
this conveyance are of especial interest, because
we are told the circumstances that led to it being
put on the road. It seems, then, that until that
year Shrewsbury had known no other than a
pack-horse service, which set out from and came
to what was then the “Pheasant,” now the “Lion
and Pheasant,” Inn on Wyle Cop, in that town.
A Mrs. Warner, a widow, was landlady, and
apparently pack-horse proprietor as well. A
shrewd fellow named Carter, a soldier who had
been billeted at the inn, made love to the widow,
married her, and managed the business. Let us
hope they were both happy and successful. At
any rate, Carter started the “Gee-ho” as the
first conveyance to ply between Shrewsbury and
London. It was a stage-waggon, drawn by eight
horses, with two others in reserve to pull it out
of those sloughs that might then be confidently
expected on the way. It was advertised to go
to or from London in seven, eight, or nine days<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
in either direction, according to the condition of
the roads.</p>

<p>Smollett’s description of how Roderick Random
and Strap easily overtook the waggon journeying
to London along the Great North Road
naturally leads to an inquiry why, if being ill-provided
with money and only lightly burdened
with luggage, they, in common with others, preferred
to pay for the doubtful privilege of going
slower than they could easily walk. The reason,
perhaps, lay partly in that lack of appreciation of
scenery which characterised the period. Poets had
not yet seen fit to rhapsodise upon the beauties of
nature, and artists had not begun to paint them.
Both were in thrills of the most exquisite rapture
on the subject of shepherds and shepherdesses, but
their Arcady was bounded by bricks and mortar.
Strephon and Chloe wore silk and satin, red-heeled
shoes and wigs, and patched and powdered amazingly.
Theirs was a bandbox Arcady, a pretty bit
of make-believe of the kind pictured by Watteau;
and though they found much poetry in lambs, they
knew nothing of the wintry horrors experienced
by the genuine shepherds in the lambing season,
and, indeed, nothing of nature outside the well-ordered
parks and formal gardens of the great.
All classes alike looked with horror upon natural
scenery, regarded the peasantry as barbarians, and
left the towns with reluctance and dismay.</p>

<p>With feelings of this kind animating the time,
it is not surprising that even humble wayfarers, ill
able to spare the money, should have sought the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
shelter and the society that the interior of the
stage-waggons afforded. Other reasons existed,
little suspected by the present generation, whose
great main roads, at any rate, are well defined and
excellently well kept. No one, nowadays, once
set upon the great roads to York and Edinburgh,
to Exeter, to Portsmouth, Dover or Bath, need
ask his way. It is only necessary to keep straight
ahead. In those old days, however, when travellers
could describe the visible road as being a narrow
track three feet wide, <em>occasionally</em> rising out of the
profound depths of mud and water on either side,
no one who could afford to pay would walk, even
assuming the very doubtful physical possibility of
struggling through such sloughs afoot.</p>

<p>In 1739 two Glasgow merchants, going horseback
from Glasgow by Edinburgh to London,
found no turnpike road until they had gone
three-quarters of their journey, and were come
to Grantham. Up to that point they travelled on
a narrow causeway, and met from time to time
strings of pack-horses, thirty to forty in a gang,
carrying goods. The leading horse of each gang
carried a bell, to give warning to travellers coming
from an opposite direction. The narrow causeway
not affording room to pass, the horsemen were
obliged to make room for the pack-horses and
plunge into the mud, out of which they sometimes
found it difficult to get back upon the road again.
Those were the times when coachmen, often finding
the old roads impassable, would make new routes
for themselves across a country not merely strange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
to turnpike roads, but still largely open and unenclosed.
Travellers then dare not go alone, if only
for a very well-founded fear of losing their way,
just as Pepys, years before, often did when travelling
in his carriage to Bath, to Oxford, Salisbury
and elsewhere. He is found paying a guide 22<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
to show him and his coachman the way between
Newport Pagnell and Oxford; 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for another
to guide him from Hungerford to Market Lavington,
and, indeed, after he had experienced the
awful seventeenth-century mischance of losing his
way two or three times through having economised
and neglected to provide this necessary aid, guides
everywhere. Travellers then achieved what we
moderns are apt to think wonderful things in thus
losing themselves. Pepys actually missed his way
on the Bath Road between Newbury and Reading,
and Thoresby lost himself riding on the Great
North Road between Doncaster and York in 1680;
in his diary fervently thanking God that he found
it again.</p>

<p>Although, by an early Act of William III.’s
reign, the justices were ordered to erect guideposts
at the cross-roads, and road surveyors were
to be fined 10<i>s.</i> if the provisions of the Act were
not complied with, such posts (except perhaps on
the road to Harwich, so often travelled by the
Third William on his journeys to and from the
Continent) were conspicuously lacking for many
generations yet to come, and no one ever seems to
have heard of country surveyors being fined for
not performing the duty thus laid upon them. An<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
exception to this picture of an uncharted wilderness
thus presented is found in the diary of Celia
Fiennes, who in the last decade of the seventeenth
century travelled through England on horseback,
and especially remarked the Lancashire cross-roads
between Wigan and Preston being furnished with
“hands pointing to each road, with ye names of
ye great towns on.” The fact of her thinking
the circumstance worth noting shows us how uncommon
it was for roads to be signposted.</p>

<p>Only the waggoners who constantly used the
roads could with certainty find their way; and so,
and for fear of the highwaymen and the footpads
and other hedgerow rascals to whom the smallest
plunder was not despicable, the waggon was a
welcome friend to the poor. Safety was thought
to lie in numbers; although it is true that, in the
moment of trial, even a waggonful of able-bodied
travellers would commonly surrender their few
valuables to the first demand of a single highwayman,
whose pistol was probably unloaded, and,
even if primed, generally refused to “go off”
when fired. It is not unnatural to prefer to be
robbed in company with a number of others, rather
than to be the solitary victim. For these reasons,
therefore, even the able-bodied and unencumbered
often chose to tediously travel with the women,
the infirm, and those whose luggage compelled.
Smollett’s humorous description of the stage-waggon
and the follies and foibles of its very
mixed passengers is the classic authority for this
stratum of road life. The sham captain, really a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
quondam valet, braggart before the timorous, but
shaking with the fear of death upon him when the
pretended highwayman appears; his wife, aping
a gentility as mean as it is transparently false;
the money-loving and peace-loving but satirical
Jew; the lively Miss Jenny, and the waggoner, are
all types, slightly caricatured, but true to the life
of the period. Putting aside the question as to
whether such people could be conjured out of his
inner consciousness without some basis of fact, we
must consider that Smollett, writing of his own
time, would not for his own sake be likely to draw
a picture which would seem a forced or unnatural
representation of the wayfaring life of the period.
Thus, when he makes his characters journey for
five days in this manner, and brings them on the
sixth to an inn where the landlord gives the meal
they had bespoken to three gentlemen who had
just arrived, we think we learn something of the
contempt with which almost every one looked down
upon passengers by stage-waggons. The gentlemen
themselves said: “The passengers in the waggon
might be d——d; their betters must be served
before them; they supposed it would be no hardship
on such travellers to dine on bread-and-cheese
for one day.” And the poor devils certainly would
have gone without their meal had it not been for
that good fellow Joey, the waggoner, who, entering
the kitchen of the inn with a pitchfork in his
hand, swore he would be the death of any man
who should pretend to seize the victuals prepared
for the waggon. “On this,” says Smollett, “the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
three strangers drew their swords, and, being
joined by their servants, bloodshed seemed imminent,
when the landlord, interposing, offered to
part with his own dinner, for the sake of peace,”
which proposal was accepted, and all ended
happily.</p>

<span class="fright"><i>After Rowlandson.</i></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>Such was the picture of travel by stage-waggon
it was possible to present to the public in 1748 as
a reasonably accurate transcript of road-life.</p>

<p>It was at that time the usual practice among
a party of travellers by waggon to elect a chairman
on setting out. The one thus set above his
fellows arranged with the waggoner where they
were to halt during the day, settled with the innkeepers
an inclusive charge for meals and accommodation,
and was treasurer, paymaster, umpire,
and general referee in all disputes. Thus was the
ancient original idea of government in larger communities—government
solely for the welfare of the
community itself—reproduced in these poor folk.</p>

<p>The gradual replacement of the pack-horses
by heavy waggons began on the most frequented
roads about the third decade of the eighteenth
century. Twelve Turnpike Acts for the improvement
of local roads had been passed in the ten
years between 1700 and 1710. They increased
by seventy-one in the next ten years, and no
fewer than two hundred and forty-five came into
existence between 1730 and 1760, followed from
1760 to 1770 by a hundred and seventy-five more.
The great number of five hundred and thirty Acts
in seventy-five years shows both the crying needs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
of the age and the energy with which the problem
of road-improvement was grasped by Parliament.
If the resulting betterment of the roads was not
so great as it should have been, that was due
rather to the unbusinesslike methods by which
the turnpike trustees despatched their business,
and not to the Government.</p>

<p>Aikin, writing of Manchester and its history,
tells how the trade of that town, carried on of old
by chapmen, owning gangs of pack-horses, began
to increase in 1730, consequent upon the improvement
of the roads. Waggons were set up, and the
chapmen, instead of setting forth with their goods
for sale, only rode out for orders, carrying patterns
with them in their saddle-bags. Thus the commercial
traveller, familiar in all the years between
1730 and the present time, came into existence.
During the forty years from 1730 to 1770, says
Aikin, the trade of Manchester was greatly pushed
by the practice of sending these “riders,” as they
were called, all over the kingdom. The goods
they sold by sample were delivered in bulk by the
waggons.</p>

<p>By 1750, the gradual introduction of two
classes of vehicles between the common stage-waggon
and the stage-coach had begun. The first
of these intermediate types was the Shrewsbury
and London “Flying Stage Waggon,” announced
to begin flying from Shrewsbury, October 22nd,
1750, to reach London in five days, winter and
summer. As Shrewsbury is 152 miles from
London, this meant thirty miles a day. Welsh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
flannels, and consignments of butter and lard and
miscellaneous goods, shared this vehicle with the
passengers. There was nothing in the build of
this new comer on the road to distinguish it from
the common stage-waggons, and it only progressed
the quicker because, following the newly-established
practice of the coaches of that period, it
changed horses at places on the way, instead of
making the whole journey with one—often tired
and exhausted—team. The other type of vehicle
was the “caravan” or “long coach,” the next
step higher in the social scale. A “caravan”
was put on the road between Shrewsbury and
London at the close of 1750. It was an affair
greatly resembling modern gipsy-vans, and was
fitted inside with benches for eight, twelve, or
even, at a pinch, eighteen persons. It was drawn
by “six able horses,” and professed to reach
London in four days, but often occupied the
whole of five. The fare to London by “caravan”
was 15<i>s.</i>—rather less than a penny-farthing a
mile. A six-horsed conveyance answering to
this description, but uncovered, is pictured by
Rowlandson fifty-six years later, on a road not
specified by him.</p>

<p>In April 1753 the “Birmingham and Shrewsbury
Long Coach” began to ply between those
places and London, completing the distance in
three and a half days; fare 18<i>s.</i> Here, evidently,
were several social grades; and when the Shrewsbury
stage-coach of the same year, charging a
guinea for an inside place, and the “Machine”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
of 1764, with a limited number of seats at
30s., each came on the scene, the several
degrees of contempt with which all these classes
of travellers, from those at twopence-farthing a
mile down to those others at a penny-farthing,
regarded one another and the lowest class, whose
shilling a day or halfpenny a mile was the lowest
common denominator in stage-waggon travelling,
must have been curious certainly, if not edifying,
to witness. The usual alternative of a halfpenny
a mile or a shilling a day gives about twenty-four
miles as a day’s journey for the common stage-waggon,
and as the Flying Waggon was advertised
to go at the rate of thirty miles a day, six miles a
day was therefore the measure of the superiority in
speed of one over the other. But the accumulated
contempt of all those social scales for the occupant
of the common waggon did not rest there, any
more than it began with the passengers of the
“Machine.” Just as the lordly and gentle folk
who had travelled in their own chariots looked
down even upon the loftiest heights of stage-coach
travelling, so did the poor folk of the waggons
unload their weight of contempt upon those poorest
of the poor, who, having nothing to lose, feared
no one—except perhaps the parish constable, apt
to be arbitrary and not always able to distinguish
between a penniless but honest wayfarer and a
rogue and vagabond. Frequently these travellers
in the lowest stratum saw the highwayman
approach, not merely without fear but with a
certain pleasurable anticipation; because your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
true knight of the road had a certain generous
code of morals, and while he robbed the rich,
gave to the needy—a thing perhaps counted to
him for righteousness by that recording angel
who effaced the record of Uncle Toby’s hasty
imprecation with a kindly obliterating tear.</p>

<p>The general increase of heavy traffic soon after
the middle of the eighteenth century did not
escape the notice of those responsible for the condition
of the roads. Incompetent road-surveyors,
ignorant of the science of road construction and
employing unsuitable materials and unskilled
labour, saw the highways they had mended with
mud, road-scrapings and gravel continually falling
into ruts and sloughs, often from twelve to eighteen
inches deep. Seeking any cause for this rather
than their ignorance of the first rudiments of
construction, they naturally discovered it in the
passage of the heavily-weighted waggons, and
raised an outcry against them accordingly. To
an age that saw no better method of mending the
roads than that of raking mud on to them and
throwing faggots and boulder-stones upon that basis,
this seemed reasonable enough, and Parliament
was at length persuaded to authorise discriminatory
rates to be imposed by the turnpike trusts upon
carts and waggons whose wheels were not of a
certain breadth. The argument was that the
broader the wheels, the greater would be the distribution
of weight, and consequently the road
would be less injured. It was an argument based,
correctly enough, upon natural laws, and the age<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
was not educated to the point of seeing that roads
should be made to the measure of the traffic they
might be called upon to bear, rather than that the
build of vehicles should be altered to suit the disabilities
of the roads themselves. So, from 1766,
a series of Turnpike Acts began, containing clauses
by which narrow wheels were penalised and broad
ones relieved. Tolls were not uniform throughout
the country, but although those one Trust would
be authorised to levy might, from some special
circumstance, be higher than others, they ranged
within narrow limits. Generally, a four-wheeled
waggon drawn by four horses, with wheels of a
less breadth than six inches, would pay a shilling
on passing a turnpike gate; with wheels measuring
six inches broad and upwards, the toll would be
ninepence; and with a breadth of nine inches
and upwards, sixpence. Not at every gate was
payment of tolls made in those old days.
Payment made at one generally “freed” the
next, and sometimes others as well; but here
again there was no general rule. Special circumstances
made some trusts liberal and others
extremely grasping.</p>

<p>A width of sixteen inches for waggon wheels
was very generally urged and adopted, and thus
it is that in old pictures of this period the great
wains have so clumsy an appearance, looking,
indeed, as though the wainwrights had not yet
learned their business, and from ignorance built
more solidly than the loads carried gave any
occasion for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
In 1773, one James Sharp, of Leadenhall Street,
advertised his invention of a “rolling waggon,”
whose rollers (in place of wheels) were of this
breadth of sixteen inches, and proceeded to state
that “two late Acts of Parliament” allowed all
carriages moving upon rollers of that gauge to
be drawn by any number of horses or cattle, and
further, that they were allowed to carry eight tons
in summer and seven in winter, and to pass toll-free
for the term of one year from Michaelmas
1773, and after that time to pay only half toll.
Clearly, then, in the great mass of legislation for
roads and traffic there was then a limit existing
for loads and for teams. It only remained for the
wisdom of the time to enact laws giving a bonus
to every waggon whose wheels exceeded a breadth
of two feet—thus making every such vehicle its
own road-repairer—for the absurdity to be complete.
There had, indeed, already arisen a bright
genius with a somewhat similar idea, for in 1763
Bourne published his design of a four-wheeled
waggon whose front axletree was to be so much
shorter than the hind one that the foremost wheels
would make a track inside the hinder. The breadth
of wheel, indeed, was not to be more than fifteen
inches, but the combined breadth of all four
planned thus would flatten out no less than a
five-foot width of road, and the heavier the contents
of the waggon, so much better for the proper
rolling of the way. But this ingenious person
took no account of the extra difficulty of haulage,
and the consequently larger teams that would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
required for this engine of his. It never came
into use, nor did the rival invention of another
amiable theorist meet a better fate. This device
set out to deal with the problem of soft and
rutted roads by fixing heavy iron rollers under
the frame of a waggon. While the vehicle
progressed along good roads these rollers were
not brought into contact with the ground, but as
soon as the wheels began to sink into foul and
miry ways, the rollers came into touch with the
surface, and at the same time prevented any
further sinking and flattened out all irregularities.</p>

<p>Turnpike roads, being then things “new-fangled”
and unusual, were of course disapproved
of by all that very numerous class who distrust
any change. Doubtful of their own ability to
hold their own in any order of things newer than
that in which they have been brought up, <em>any</em>
change must to them be for the worse. The
waggoners to a man were numbered in this class,
and, apart from the tolls to be paid on the new
roads, objected to them as new. An entertaining
contributor to the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> in 1752
consulted “the most solemn waggoner” he could
find between London and Bath. This was one
“Jack Whipcord,” who, like every one else, preferred
to go round by “a miserable waggon-track
called ‘Ramsbury Narrow Way.’ Jack’s answer
was, that roads had but one object—namely,
waggon-driving; that he required but five feet
width in a lane (which he resolved never to quit),
and all the rest might go to the devil. That the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
gentry ought to stay at home and be damned, and
not run gossipping up and down the country. No
turnpikes, no improvements of roads for him. The
Scripture for him was Jeremiah vi. 16.<a id="FNanchor_E" href="#Footnote_E" class="fnanchor">E</a> Thus,”
says the writer, “finding Jack an ill-natured
brute and a profane country wag, I left him,
dissatisfied.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_E" href="#FNanchor_E" class="fnanchor">E</a> “Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths,
where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest
for your souls.”</p></div>

<p>We are not to suppose, from this imaginary
“Jack Whipcord,” that waggoners were generally
of a dour and unpleasant nature. Indeed, the
consensus of opinion to be collected from old-world
literature shows that, as a class, they
were pleasant and light-hearted. M. Samuel de
Sorbière, a distinguished Frenchman who visited
England in 1663 and has left a very entertaining
account of his travels, paints a charming little
cameo portrait of the waggoner who was in charge
of the six-horse stage-waggon by which he travelled
from Dover to Gravesend. The horses were yoked
one before the other, and beside them walked the
waggoner, “clothed in black and appointed in all
things like another Saint George. He had a brave
mounteero on his head, and was a merry fellow,
who fancied he made a figure and seemed mightily
pleased with himself.” “Joey,” too, the waggoner
already glimpsed in <i>Roderick Random</i>, was
sprightly and light-hearted; and we have the
evidence of that old English ballad, the “Jolly
Waggoner,” that men of this trade were conventionally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
regarded as devil-me-care fellows, own
brothers in disposition to sailors, always represented
as jolly, even in the old days when rations
were scanty and bad and rope’s endings plentiful.
This jollity is insisted upon, even by the old
wayside signs of the country inns. Now and
again you may find the sign of the “Jolly
Anglers,” while on the Portsmouth Road the
“Jolly Drovers” is to be seen, and on the Exeter
Road the “Jolly Farmer,” a creature vanished
from this country and utterly unknown these
forty years and more; but only the waggoners
and the sailors are usually known by that adjective.
Rarely, indeed, is the sailor described in
any other way. In a few instances he may be
“Valiant,” but ninety times in every hundred he
is “Jolly.”</p>

<p>According to the second verse of the “Jolly
Waggoner,” his cheerfulness was <span class="locked">invincible:—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p class="in0">He knew something of all kinds of weather, and
met all kinds of men in his daily journeys, and
thus early became something of a philosopher,
looking forward for nothing beyond his nightly
inn, in whose kitchen he was well known and
esteemed, alike for his own qualities and the news
and parcels he brought from the outer world on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
the other side of the distant hills. With a sack
over his shoulders and peace in his mind, he could
greet the rainy days with joke and song, or endure
even the wintry horrors of December and January
with equanimity; yet when spring was come and
grass grew green and the bare, ruined boughs of the
trees began to be clothed again with leaves, not
even the old heathen Greeks and Romans in their
Floralia celebrated the coming again of the sun
with more heartiness. His horses and himself
were decked with ribbons on May Day, his sweetheart
had some longed-for present from the Great
City, and not even the blackbird on the hawthorn
spray sang a merrier tune, as he drove his team
along their steady pace.</p>

<p>It is not a little difficult to pronounce an
opinion upon the fares which the poor folk paid
by stage-waggon. Prices varied widely. On the
Great North Road in 1780, between London and
Edinburgh, the measure was, indeed, not by miles
but by days; but as the journey took fourteen
days, and the fare was a shilling a day, and the
distance covered was 396 miles, we can figure it
out at about twenty-eight miles a day at something
less than a halfpenny a mile. Early stage-waggons
to Cambridge, however, appear to have exacted
three-halfpence a mile, and moved with incredible
slowness, taking two and a half days to perform
the fifty-one miles, and sleeping two nights upon
the road. On the Bath Road the waggon-fare
seems to have been something less than a penny
a mile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
We have already seen something of the old
waggon-life, as shown by Smollett: let us now
inquire into the costs and charges of the journey,
apart from the fare. How did these humble folk
eat and drink, and how did they lodge for the
night when the waggon came to its inn at sunset?
Sometimes they slept in the shelter of the waggon
itself, under the substantial covering of the great
canvas tilt, snugly curled up in the hay and
straw, and barricaded by the crates and boxes that
formed part of the load—not an altogether uncomfortable,
if certainly too promiscuous, a sleeping
arrangement. At other times the stable-lofts of
the inns formed their apartments. Landlords of
reputable hostelries, mindful of the social gulf
that (in the opinion of the insides) existed between
the inside passengers of a stage-coach and those
off-scourings of the country who rode on the roof
or in the “basket,” did not commonly allow those
belonging to that even lower stratum, the waggons,
to sleep in their houses. A supper of cold boiled
beef and bread in the kitchen, followed by a
shake-down in the hay or straw of the stables, at
an inclusive price of sixpence or ninepence, was
their portion. Swift himself, that terrible genius
of the eighteenth century, who knew the extremities
of obscurity and fame, of penury and affluence,
was, in his early days, of this poor company.
When a young man, travelling from the house of
his patron, Sir William Temple, at Moor Park,
near Farnham, in Surrey, to see his mother at
Leicester, he rode in the waggon, and slept at “the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
penny hedge-inns,” where they were not above
letting a bed for the night to a young man so
unusually particular as to pay sixpence extra for
clean sheets and a bed to himself—an exclusive
arrangement, it would appear, not within the
everyday philosophy of those humble caravanserais.
He whom not only later ages, but even
his contemporaries, unite in acclaiming a genius,
generally chose to take his food with waggoners,
ostlers, and persons of that station. The superfine
Lord Orrery, who recorded these facts, and tells
us that Swift “delighted in scenes of low life,”
says he “dined” with them; but if Lord Orrery
had been as well acquainted with humble circles
he would have known that the low people in them
do not “dine” at all; they just “have dinner.”</p>

<span class="fright"><i>After J. Pollard.</i></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>It is impossible to obtain more than a glimpse
of the early carriers, and even the later stage-waggons
were only occasionally advertised in the
newspapers of the past. Thus, turning to Sussex,
we only hear of “Thomas Smith, the Old Lewes
Carrier,” in a reference to him after his death.
How many years he had jogged along the green
Surrey and Sussex lanes on his weekly journeys
between Southwark and Lewes we know not. He
died in 1746, and his widow carried on the business,
according to her advertisement in the <i>Lewes
Journal</i>:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“THOMAS SMITH, the <span class="smcap">Old Lewes Carrier</span>,
being dead, <span class="smcap">the business is now continued
by his widow, Mary Smith</span>, who gets into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
‘George Inn,’ in the Borough, Southwark, <span class="smcap">every
Wednesday</span> in the afternoon, and sets out for
Lewes <span class="smcap">every Thursday</span> morning by eight o’clock,
and brings Goods and Passengers to Lewes,
Fletching, Chayley, Newick, and all places
adjacent at reasonable rates. Performed (<i>if God
permit</i>) by <span class="smcap">Mary Smith</span>.”</p></blockquote>

<p>No mention yet, it will be observed, of
Brighton, that little fisher-village of Brighthelmstone
which presently was to rival fashionable Bath.
The waggon went no farther than Lewes; and
the first public conveyance to Brighton appears to
have been the “Brighthelmstone Stage” of May
1756, running as an extension of the “London
and Lewes One-Day Stage.”</p>

<p>Speed was by no means sought upon these old
waggon-journeys. Quite apart from their usual
inability to go, under the most favourable circumstances,
at more than about four miles an hour,
they were exempt from passenger-duty, on all
travellers carried, only when the rate of progression
did not exceed that speed.</p>

<p>Thus, although the Brighton waggon owned by
Tubb and Davis in 1770 had a rival conveyance
put on the road in 1776 by Lashmar &amp; Co., both
continued at the old pace. Both went by way of
East Grinstead and Lewes, and took three days to
perform the fifty-eight miles, Lashmar’s waggon
leaving the “King’s Head,” Southwark, every
Tuesday at 3 a.m., and arriving at the “King’s
Head,” Brighton, on Thursday afternoons. Goods<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
and parcels were carried at the rates of 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
and 3<i>s.</i> per cwt.</p>

<p>Malachy Postlethwayt’s <i>Dictionary of Trade</i>,
a work published in 1751, gives some eloquent
details on this subject of the carriage of goods.
Comparing that year, when turnpikes had improved
the roads, with the bad ways of thirty or forty
years earlier, it is stated that where six horses
could in former times scarcely draw 30 cwt.
sixty miles, they could then draw 50 or 60 cwt.
Carriage, too, was cheaper by 30 per cent. than
before. In 1750 there were from twenty-five to
thirty waggons sent weekly from Birmingham to
London, carrying goods at from £3 to £4 a ton;
thirty years earlier the cost had been £7 a ton.
Between Portsmouth and London freights had
fallen from £7 to £4 or £5; and between Exeter
and London and other towns in the west of like
distance from £12 to £8. Postlethwayt cited these
figures with pride, but he argued that the heavy
waggons wore out the roads, and that they did not
pay sufficient toll. The manufacturers, he thought,
got too much advantage out of these low freights,
and although the public thereby could purchase
goods more cheaply, they paid their savings all
out again in the heavy repairs of the highway and
the consequent extravagant highway rates rendered
necessary. Railway rates, we may here remark,
are a source of much bitter discussion to-day, but
they are fifteen times less than the reduced rates
of 1750.</p>

<p>Even in the last days of the road, when railways<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
had already begun to stretch the length and
breadth of the land, the waggons on the less
important highways continued very much as they
had been accustomed to do; but with the second
decade of the nineteenth century a demand for the
quicker conveyance of goods arose on those great
roads that gave access from the important manufacturing
towns to London, or from London to the
chief seaports. With this demand, in the improved
condition of those roads, it now became for the
first time possible to comply. On less frequented
routes—roads leading to agricultural districts and
sleepy old towns and villages that produced nothing
for distant markets and wanted little from them—the
common stage waggon and the flying waggon
lingered. The Kendal Flying Waggon of 1816,
pictured by Rowlandson, halting at a wayside inn
to take up or set down goods and passengers and
to change horses, lasted well on into the railway
age; but in places nearer to and in more direct
communication with the commerce of great cities,
the type was early supplemented by later contrivances.</p>

<p>The first of these were the “Fly Vans,” of
which the swift conveyances of Russell &amp; Co.,
van proprietors, trading between London and the
West of England, were typical. They were built
on the model of the wooden hooded van seen in
London streets at the present time, but considerably
larger than now common. Russells had for many
years continued a service of stage-waggons between
the port of Falmouth and the Metropolis. Drawn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
by the then usual team of eight horses, augmented
by two, or even four, more on many of the hills
that make the west-country roads a constant succession
of ups and downs, they had brought heavy
goods and luggage that distance in twelve days, at
the rate of three miles an hour, carrying passengers
at a halfpenny a mile. But with the coming of
the nineteenth century they found the stage-coaches,
with their “rumble-tumbles,” beginning
to carry people at a slightly higher fare, and
performing the whole distance of 269 miles
in three days and nights. Even the poorest
found it cheaper to pay the higher fare and save
the delays and expenses of the other nine days,
and so Messrs. Russell found one branch of their
trade decaying. They accordingly, about 1820,
put their “Fly Vans” on the road, vehicles which
did the journey in the same time as the ordinary
stage-coaches of that period, and, running night
and day, continued so to set forth and come to
their journey’s end until the railway came and
presently made away with fly vans, stage-coaches
and mails alike.</p>

<p>A sign of the times immediately preceding
railways was the appearance of the heavy covered
luggage and goods vans, exclusively devoted to
that class of traffic and carrying no passengers.
How the heavy goods of Birmingham and other
great towns were then conveyed along the roads
is shown in the curious and very interesting
old painting, engraved here, of Pickford &amp; Co.’s
London and Manchester Luggage Van. The roads<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
between London and the great manufacturing
towns at length became crowded with goods, and
had it not been for the railways, they must at an
early date have become altogether inadequate, and
an era of great highway improvement and widening
have set in, notwithstanding that quite two-thirds
of the goods traffic at that time was water-borne,
and went by those canals with which the genius
of Brindley and Telford, and the enterprise of the
Duke of Bridgewater and others, had half a century
earlier intersected the trade routes and manufacturing
centres of the country.</p>

<p>It is at once instructive and interesting here to
glance at the figures prepared by the promoters of
the London and Birmingham Railway, opened in
1838, by which they argued the pressing need of a
railway, which should carry cheaper and quicker.
They gave several sets of estimates, whose discrepancies
are to be accounted for by the increasing
volume of traffic; but, to reduce their figures to
round numbers, it seems that in the year before
the line was begun, the annual average of goods
despatched between Birmingham and London was
144,000 tons, carried at rates of from fivepence to
sixpence a mile per ton by the “Fly-boats” on the
canal and by the vans and waggons. By canal
the annual expenditure was £227,000, by road
£113,000. Passengers, numbering 488,342, at an
average of twopence a head per mile on the 109

<p>To those who unfailingly see the wise direction
of Providence in everything, it would seem that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
Providence had thus raised up railway engineers
and capitalists at the psychological moment; but
the views of coach-proprietors, coachmen, guards,
ostlers, innkeepers, and the innumerable others
depending in one way or another upon the road
for a living, did not, it is to be feared, look so
complacently upon the new era which in many
instances ruined them. Nor, perhaps, did those
who were financially interested in canals ascribe
the new order of things to providential interposition.</p>

<p>That, indeed, is providential which advances
one’s own interests and preserves one’s well-being,
but misfortunes are generally given a very different
ascription. The providential interpositions that
benefited one class inflicted very great hardship
and loss upon another. The canals that were,
before the introduction of railways, very great and
keen competitors with the waggons, were frozen
up in severe winters, and all traffic along them
stopped, and thus the whole of the carrying trade
went by road, greatly to the advantage of the turnpike
trusts and the owners of waggons. Indeed,
severe winters, if unaccompanied by snow, were in
every way advantageous to the waggons, because
the frost-bound roads gave good going, while
“open” winters made the highways a sea of mud
and almost impassable.</p>

<p>Although with the coming of the railways the
stage-waggons swiftly disappeared from such direct
commercial routes as those between London and
Birmingham and London and Manchester, this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
ancient type of vehicle lingered amazingly on the
purely agricultural roads leading to the Metropolis
out of Kent, Sussex and Surrey. As the stage-waggon
was the earliest of old road vehicles, so
also it was the last; and even when the last coach
came off the road, and people travelled only by
train, there were still left not a few of the old
waggons continuing their sober journeys, not in the
least affected by the railways. They came to and
set out from London very much as they had been
used to do two hundred and forty years before,
and resorted as of old to the ancient inns that
lingered in such strongholds of the old road-faring
interest as the Borough High Street, Aldgate and
Whitechapel, and Bishopsgate Street. It is true
they carried passengers no longer, for when railway
travel came, and was cheap as well as speedy, there
were none who could afford the time taken of old
by waggon. It was cheaper to pay a railway fare,
and thus save a day or even more. But with
heavy goods it long remained far otherwise, and
even into the ’sixties it was possible to see the
lethargic waggons still ponderously coming to their
haven out of Kent and Sussex at the “Talbot” in
the Borough (only demolished in 1870), from the
Eastern Counties to the “Blue Boar” or the “Saracen’s
Head” in Aldgate, or from the North to the
“Four Swans,” the “Bull,” or the “Green Dragon,”
in Bishopsgate Street Within, precisely as they had
done from the beginning, when Shakespeare was
play-writing. They were built in the same fashion
as of yore. The immense canvas-covered tilts had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
not changed their pattern, and their dim old horn
lanterns were genuine antiques; their wheels, as
clumsy as ever they had been, shrieked for grease
and racked the ears of the lieges as they had
always done; and the lieges swore at the waggoners
and the waggoners cursed back at them in strange
provincial dialects, just as their respective ancestors
had been wont to do for more generations than one
cares to count. The Londoner little imagined—because
his imagination on any subject is small—when
he looked dully upon these old conveyances,
and the old inns to which they came, that
he was gazing upon a survival of the age of Elizabeth;
and while he was thus failing to realise the
exquisite interest of what he saw, the “common
stage waggons,” as they were technically named
by Act of Parliament, ceased altogether off the
face of the earth, and nearly all the old galleried
inns were swept away.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE EARLY MAIL-COACHES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">Long</span> before the last quarter of the eighteenth
century dawned, the time was ripe for Post Office
reform in the carrying of the mails; but, as a
matter of course, no one within that department
saw any necessity for change, and although the
Post Office revenue was suffering severely from
correspondence being sent in a clandestine manner
by stage-coach, the slow and uncertain old methods
had been retained. Reform had, as always, to
come from without, just as when Ralph Allen
of Bath planned his service of postboys in 1719.
He had, against much opposition, introduced his
system of messengers riding with the mails at a
speed of “not less than five miles an hour,” then
considered great expedition, and comparing very
favourably with the average stage-coach speed of
something less than four miles, including stops.
Allen’s postboys were at that time the fastest
travellers on the road, with the exception of the
highwaymen, whose blood mares, according to
tradition, were faster still. No one could grumble
at the course of post in those days on the score
of comparison with the journeys made by other
travellers; but, like many other reforms, Allen’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
postboys, excellent at the beginning, did not wholly
succeed in keeping abreast of the times. Roads
improved: everyone and everything went at a
much greater rate of progression, save the Post
Office postboys, who for forty-six years continued
to go at the same speed as that of their predecessors
of an earlier generation. They were, indeed, sent
out more frequently on certain routes on which
business had increased, and on the more frequented
roads the mails were, from June 1741, despatched
six days in the week, instead of twice and thrice,
as had formerly been the case; but up to the
time of Allen’s death, in 1764, speed remained
what it had always been, and it was not until the
following year that the postboys’ regulation rate
of travelling was raised by Act of Parliament from
five to six miles an hour, inclusive of stops. The
post-horses were, however, of the same inferior
kind as of old. The best animals were, very
naturally, kept back by the postmasters—who were
generally the innkeepers also—for their customers,
and for the Post Office the worst nags in the stable
were invariably reserved. An Act of Parliament,
backed by the power of the executive, is a very
dread thing, but it has not the power of compelling
a horse incapable of going more than a certain
number of miles an hour to add another mile to
his speed. The improvement could thus have
been only nominal.</p>

<p>The Post Office officials in Lombard Street,
where the General Post Office was then situated,
were very well content for the public service to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
be continued as of old. It would be idle to
speculate how long the department would have
lagged behind the times and seen the Post Office
revenues being gradually eaten away by the
growing practice of secretly sending letters by
the stage-coaches, which had by this time attained
a speed of about seven miles an hour, and in
addition set out more frequently and at more
convenient hours than the postboys. It would be
idle thus to speculate, because, when the scandal
was growing to noticeable proportions—when it
was asserted that the Post Office lost not less
than £80,000 a year by letters being conveyed
by unauthorised persons, and when people grew
indignant that “every common traveller passed
the King’s Mail”—there came to the front a man
with a plan to remedy what surely was the very
absurd paradox that the Government strenuously
reserved to itself the monopoly of letter-carrying,
and yet provided no reasonable facilities for those
letters to be conveyed, and idly watched thousands
of pounds of that cherished revenue being annually
diverted from their proper destination. This man
with a well-matured scheme of reform was John
Palmer, a native of Bath, born at No. 1, Galloway’s
Buildings (now North Parade Buildings), in 1742.
His father was a brewer and spermaceti-merchant,
and proprietor of two highly prosperous theatres
at Bath and another at Bristol. Intended by his
father for the Church, his own inclinations were
for the Army; but he was not suffered to follow
his bent, and so was taken from school and placed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
in the counting-house of his father’s brewery.
Wearying of that commercial routine, and still
without success disputing the question of entering
the Army, he set about learning the practical side
of brewing, and worked among the vats and mash-tubs
of his father’s establishment. Then his health
gave way, and signs of consumption rendered a
rest and change of air necessary. Recovering at
last and returning to Bath, he entered into the
conduct of his father’s theatrical enterprises, and
at the time when he conceived his plan was the
very busy and successful manager of all these
theatres, for which his energy had secured Royal
patents—a license then necessary for the presentation
of stage-plays. These patents were then the
only ones enjoyed by theatres out of London.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>JOHN PALMER AT THE AGE OF 17.
<span class="fright"><i>Attributed to Gainsborough, R.A.</i></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>Palmer was, therefore, no impecunious adventurer,
but a theatrical proprietor and manager,
accustomed to secure the highest talent for his
houses in this resort of fashion. His native
energy, that brought him success in beating up
for talented actors and actresses all over the
country, stood him in good stead when the idea
of entirely remodelling the carrying of the mails
occurred to his active mind. Nothing, indeed,
short of the utmost persistence and determination
could have surmounted the obstacles to reform that
were placed in his way by the Post Office officials.</p>

<p>The mails he had perceived to be the slowest
travelling in the kingdom, and he decided that
they ought to be, and should be, the quickest.
His own frequent journeys had shown him the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
possibilities, and long observation at Bath had
displayed how far short of these the postboys’
journeys always fell. Thirty-eight hours were
generally taken to perform the 109 miles between
the General Post Office and Bath, at a time when
travellers posted down in post-chaises in one day.</p>

<p>Other objections to postboys existed than on the
score of insufficient speed. It was, he declared,
in the last degree hazardous to entrust the mail-bags—as
inevitably was often done—to some idle
boy, without character, and mounted on a worn-out
hack, who, so far from being able to defend himself
against a robber, was more likely to be in
league with one.</p>

<p>Post Office postboys, it should here be said,
were, like the postboys who drove the post-chaises,
by no means necessarily boys or youths. They
included, it is true, in their ranks all ages, but
the great majority of them were grown-up, not to
say aged, men. Some people, indeed, recognising
the absurdity of calling a decrepit old man a
“postboy,” preferred to give him the title of
“mailman,” by which name a postal servant who
got drunk and delayed the Bath mail in 1770 is
styled in a contemporary newspaper, which says,
“The mail did not arrive so soon by several hours
as usual on Monday, owing to the mailman getting
a little intoxicated on his way between Newbury
and Marlborough and falling from his horse into
a hedge, where he was found asleep by means of
his dog.”</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>JOHN PALMER.<br />
<span class="fright"><i>From the painting by Gainsborough, R.A.</i></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>Instead of exposing letters to these and other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
risks, Palmer proposed that a service of mail-coaches
should be established on every great road.</p>

<p>It was a bold scheme, and seemed to most of
those to whom it was unfolded rash and unworkable.
To quite understand this attitude of mind
on the part of Palmer’s contemporaries, both inside
and outside the Post Office, it is essential to project
ourselves mentally into those closing years of
the eighteenth century, when no one travelled save
under direful compulsion, when correspondence
between sundered friends and relatives was fitful
and infrequent, and when even business relations
between the newly-risen industries of the great
towns and the rural districts were carried on
in what we now consider to have been a most
leisurely and somnolent manner. The world went
very well then for the indolent, and they resented
any quickening of the pace; and that the average
acute business men of that age considered the course
of post reasonable seems evident when we consider
that it was not from their ranks that this reforming
project came, and that they are not found
supporting it until the first mails had been put
on the road and proved successful. <em>Then</em> that
imagination which had been altogether lacking or
dormant in business minds was aroused, and the
great towns and cities not at first provided with
these new facilities eagerly petitioned the Post
Office authorities for mail-coaches.</p>

<p>Palmer contended that mail-coaches could be
established at no greater expense than that of
the postboys and horses, who cost threepence a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
mile. At a time, he continued, when stage-coaches
cost their proprietors about twopence a
mile, it was quite certain that adventurers
could be found to establish mail-coaches if the
Government would consent to pay them at the
same rate as the postboys, to exempt them from
the heavy tolls to which ordinary traffic was
liable, and to permit passengers to be carried to
enable these speculative persons to earn a profit
on their enterprise. The proposed exemption from
toll was very reasonable when we consider how
onerous were the turnpike charges on the Bath
Road, typical as it was of others. The charges for a
carriage and four horses between London and Bath
were not less than 18<i>s.</i>, or about twopence a mile.</p>

<p>These mail-coaches, he considered, should travel
at about eight or nine miles an hour. They should
carry no outside passengers, but were to be provided
with a guard, who, for the better protection
of the mails, should be armed with two short guns
or blunderbusses. The coachman, too, should be
armed, but his equipment was to be two pistols,
for with his reins to hold with one hand he could
not, like the guard, bring his weapon to the
shoulder. The journey, for example, between
London and Bath, it was thought, could be performed
in sixteen hours, including stoppages; and
this unusual expedition, together with the assured
safety, would result in the projected coaches being
well patronised by the public.</p>

<p>This plan was matured in 1782, and Palmer
lost no time in securing the good offices of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
influential friend to bring it to the notice of the
“Heaven-born Minister,” Pitt, then Chancellor
of the Exchequer. The time, however, was not
propitious, for the ministry soon went out of
office, and it was not until 1784, when he was
again in power, that Palmer’s plan obtained a
trial. Pitt was heartily in favour of it, and
carried it into effect against the unanimously
adverse opinions of the Post Office surveyors, who
resented one outside their own sanctified and
anointed caste daring to suggest that the methods
of the department were capable of improvement.
One was, or affected to be, unable to see why the
post should be the swiftest conveyance in the
kingdom; and to another it appeared that for
guards and coachmen to carry arms would be to
encourage the highwaymen—who assuredly would
continue to attack the mail—to a greater use than
before of pistols, so that murder would be added
to robbery and the country run with blood. In
conclusion, they were all amazed that any dissatisfaction
or desire for change should exist, and
from that amazement proceeded to argue that they
really did not exist. If (they said) the mails were
not frequent enough or swift enough, there were
always the expresses ready to be specially hired.
Now, as at that time a letter going a hundred
miles by mail would cost fourpence, and the cost
of an express—at threepence a mile and a two-and-sixpenny
fee—would for the same distance
be 27<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, this surprise was not altogether
unlike that of Marie Antoinette, who, hearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
that the people were starving for lack of bread,
wondered why they did not eat cakes instead.</p>

<p>These official objections having been brushed
aside at a Treasury conference held on June 21st,
arrangements were made for a coach to run on
the road from Bristol, through Bath, to London,
pursuant to an order issued on July 24th, which
stated that “His Majesty’s Postmasters-General,
being inclined to make an experiment for the
more expeditious conveyance of mails of letters by
stage-coaches, machines, etc., have been pleased
to order that a trial shall be made upon the road
between London and Bristol, to commence at each
place on Monday the 2nd August next.”</p>

<p>On July 31st, 1784, five innholders—one in
London, one at Thatcham, one at Marlborough,
and two in Bath—entered into an agreement to
horse the coach down that ancient turnpike.
They received threepence a mile for their services.</p>

<p>A conflict of testimony as to whether the first
mail-coach started on August 2nd, 1784, or on
August 8th, seems to be disposed of by the
advertisement in <i>Bonner &amp; Middleton’s Bristol
Journal</i> of July 31st in that year, although there
is nothing in succeeding issues of that journal to
show whether the service actually did or did not
begin on the date <span class="locked">announced:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
Immediately beneath this advertisement it is
amusing to see a counterblast, in the form of an
announcement by Pickwick, Weeks, and other
“Proprietors of the Coaches from Bristol, Bath,
and London,” who “respectfully beg leave to
inform the Public that they continue to run their
Coaches from the Bush Tavern in Corn Street,
Bristol,” and from other inns in that city and
at Bath, “with equal Expedition to any Coaches
that travel the Road.” Stage-coach proprietors
in general were, not unnaturally, alarmed and
angered by the inauguration of a swift service of
subsidised mail-coaches, not only claiming to
perform their journeys in a specified time, but
actually doing so under contracts providing for
penalties when the official time-table was not
kept. <em>They</em> were under no such obligations, and
continually claimed to do things impossible to be
performed, secure from penalties. “What time
do you get to London?” asked a passenger of a
stage-coachman. “Six o’clock, sir, is the proper
time, but I have been every hour of the four-and-twenty
after it,” was the reply.</p>

<p>The first mail-coaches were merely ordinary
light post coaches or diligences pressed into the
service; but, unlike those of other and unofficial
coaches, whose stages ranged from ten to fifteen
miles or more, the horses were changed at stages
varying from six to eight miles. In this way it
was possible to attain a running speed of eight
miles an hour, to destroy the old reproach that
the mail was the slowest service in the kingdom,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
and to set the pace to everything else on the road.
Thus once again the Post Office commanded the
utmost expedition, and to the mail-coaches those
travellers flocked who desired the quickest, the
most dignified, and the safest method of progression
in that age.</p>

<p>The first results of the mail-coach system were
of a very mixed nature. The course of post was,
it is true, greatly accelerated, but the rates of
postage were immediately raised, and although
the added convenience was well worth the extra
charge—which, after all, was much less than the
surreptitious sending of letters by stage-coach had
been—people grumbled. By the ordinary postboys
the charge for a single letter had been a penny
for one stage, twopence for two stages, and threepence
for any higher distance up to eighty miles.
Over that distance the charge was fourpence.
The postboys’ stages ranged from ten to as many
as fourteen miles. Under the new dispensation
the postage was raised at once to twopence the
first stage, and the stages themselves were rarely
more than seven or eight miles, and often shorter.
Correspondence going longer distances enjoyed, it
is true, a reduction; for two stages cost threepence
and distances exceeding two stages and not more
than eighty miles were rated at fourpence.</p>

<p>The short-distance correspondence therefore
paid from three to four times as much as under
the old order of things, and long-distance letters
a penny more; but all alike shared the advantage
of the mail-coaches’ comparative immunity from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
attack and their going every day, including even
Sundays. One class of correspondents, indeed,
suffered inconvenience for a time while reorganisation
was in progress. These were the residents
on the bye-roads and in the smaller towns not
situated on the great mail routes. It is obvious
that the coaches could not be made to go along
the secondary and very ill-kept roads, and that,
even could that have been done, it would not
have been possible, in the lack of passenger traffic
along them, to have found contractors prepared to
horse the coaches at the price they gladly accepted
on the main arteries of travelling. The postboys
had, on the other hand, gone everywhere, and the
complex system of bye- and cross-posts established
by Allen and maintained by these riders was
really, for that time, a wonderful achievement.
Residents off the mail routes now began to miss
the postboy’s horn, and found their letters lying
for days at the post-offices until they were called
for. Instead of the post coming to the smaller
towns and villages, those minor places had to
send to the nearest post-office on the mail-coach
road. These inconveniences only gradually disappeared
on the organisation of a service of mail-carts
from the post-towns to rural post-offices,
collecting and delivering the cross-posts; and it
was not until another ten years had passed that
the bye-mails became, as well as the direct ones,
what they should always have been, quicker than
any other public conveyance on the roads. With
this at length accomplished, the leakage of Post<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
Office revenues automatically disappeared, for it
is not to be supposed that, when the mails were
more; frequent, cheaper, and more speedy than
other methods, the public would resort to slow
and more expensive ways of sending their letters.</p>

<p>The next mail-coach to be put on the road was
the Norwich Mail, in March 1785; and in May
of that same year the first of the cross-road
mails was established. This was the Bristol and
Portsmouth. It was followed in rapid succession
by the long services from London: the Leeds,
Manchester and Liverpool, on July 25th; the
London, Gloucester and Swansea; the Hereford,
Carmarthen and Milford Haven, by Glasbury; the
Worcester and Ludlow; the Birmingham and
Shrewsbury; the Chester and Holyhead; the
Exeter; the Portsmouth; and—on October 16th,
1786, in answer to the petition for a mail-coach
along the Great North Road sent up by the cities
and towns on that highway—by the York and
Edinburgh Mail.</p>

<p>Palmer was not content with merely reorganising
the inland mails; he was eager to see
his plan adopted in France, and to this end
opened up negotiations with Baron D’Ogny,
the French Minister of Posts, in 1787. Correspondence
between them, and between his
secretary, Andrew Todd, and M. de Richebourg,
was still proceeding in 1791, when the French
Revolution put an end to all such things.</p>

<p>The success of his plan in England was no
sooner assured than his position came up for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
discussion. We must by no means regard Palmer
as a mere sentimental reformer. Nothing could
be wider of the truth. He thought he saw, in
thus being of service to the public, an excellent
opportunity of furthering his own fortunes. He
had observed how great a fortune Allen had made
by the posts being farmed to him, and although
by this time the business of the Post Office was
grown too huge to be let out at a rent, his acute
mind, as we have seen, devised a plan that
brought him little financial risk or outlay. His
were the brains; the Post Office, and the
contractors who horsed the coaches, took the
responsibility and the risk, if any.</p>

<p>It was now only to be expected that he should
be rewarded for his idea and for the way in which
he had brought the plan into being. He was
accordingly, but not until October 1786,
appointed Comptroller-General, with a yearly
salary of £1,500, and 2½ per cent. on the net
revenue in excess of £250,000; which sum
represented the former Post Office revenue of
£150,000 plus the £90,000 the newly-raised rates
of postage had added to the year’s takings.</p>

<p>It is not the purpose of these pages to enter
into the long and pitiful story of the hatreds and
jealousies that Palmer’s appearance at the Post
Office excited, nor does the subject in hand admit
any extended study of Palmer’s own character.
When he went to the Post Office as Comptroller-General,
he went with a determination to be
unfettered in his actions, and expected to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
supreme in fact, although nominally responsible
to the Postmasters-General. At this period the
Post Office, which had staggered on from job to
job from its very inception, and had been purged
from time to time only to settle down on every
occasion into a new era of corruption and theft of
every degree, from the most pettifogging pilfering
up to malversation of funds on a monumental
scale, was riddled through and through with
scandals. There had long been a succession of
joint Postmasters-General from 1690, when Sir
Robert Cotton and Mr. Thomas Frankland were
appointed; and that double-barrelled office,
although conducted by those first incumbents in
an efficient and altogether praiseworthy manner,
had long degenerated into a political appointment.
Cotton and Frankland had been more than official
figureheads. They had resided at the General
Post Office, and were hard-working and conscientious
servants of the public. Their successors
degenerated into impracticable officers of State,
who usually only took part in Post Office work
to the extent of signing official documents they
never read, and never actively interfered but to
perpetrate some new job, or—for they commonly
were violently jealous of one another—for the
purpose of undoing some already existent scandal
set agoing by their fellow Postmaster-General.</p>

<p>It was Palmer’s misfortune to go to the Post
Office at a time when these gilded figureheads
were not perhaps more efficient, but certainly
more interfering, than the generality, and, being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
himself hot-headed and impatient of control, he
very soon came to disagreement from them.
Their suggestions he at first haughtily ignored, as
in his opinion likely to injure his plans, and when
those suggestions became commands, he entirely
disobeyed them. The chiefs with whom he thus
came into bitter conflict were at first Lords
Carteret and Walsingham: the former a “job-master,”
as Palmer satirically styled him, of
peculiar shamelessness and audacity; his colleague
a man of probity, but with something of the
formal prig in his constitution that irritated
Palmer at last beyond endurance. Walsingham
made a point of investigating everything. He
may not have been a better man of business than
Palmer, but he was a man of orderly methods,
which Palmer was not. Palmer did things well,
but in an unbusinesslike way; Walsingham must
for ever be seeking precedents, calling for vouchers,
and insisting upon official etiquette. All this was
very poisonous to the new Comptroller-General, who
found himself largely controlled instead of controlling.
Carteret, being convicted by his colleague
of a job, Palmer hotly thought his own honesty
questioned when careless and unreported appointments
solely on his own initiative were resented
by his official superior. Thus affairs continued
through six years of changes, in which Postmasters-General
succeeded one another and returned like
the changes of a kaleidoscope. But while other
Postmasters disappeared, Walsingham, the stickler
for form, remained. With others Palmer might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
have found some way of compromise, but with
Walsingham he could not do other than carry on
a struggle for mastery. The end came when that
peer had for his fellow the Earl of Chesterfield,
who possessed sufficient humour by himself to be
amused with Palmer’s frettings against authority,
but in conjunction with Walsingham could only
follow his lead. Annoyed beyond his own powers
of control (which, to be sure, were very limited)
by the action of the joint Postmasters in referring
to the Treasury an affair which he conceived to be
a purely Post Office matter, concerning the mileage
to be paid for the Carlisle and Portpatrick mail,
Palmer forthwith suddenly stopped on his own
authority the Falmouth, Bristol, Portsmouth and
Plymouth mail-coaches, which were all being paid
for at a higher rate than his superiors thought
necessary, but which they had not agreed to
discontinue. Questioned about this action, that
had thrown the mails in the south-west of England
into utter confusion, he insolently declared that
what their lordships objected to on one road was
surely objectionable on another; if they preferred
mail-carts to mail-coaches they could have them.
A violent quarrel then blazed up. Palmer
charged the Postmasters-General with deliberately
and capriciously thwarting his best arrangements.
He would appeal to the Prime Minister against
their interference.</p>

<p>The Postmasters desired nothing better; but
Pitt, who had the greatest confidence in Palmer,
long evaded the interview they sought with him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
to procure his dismissal, and when at length they
did win to his presence he made it quite clear
that it was not in their direction his sympathies
extended. Indeed, it is quite possible that the
Comptroller-General would have seen his masters
out of office while he retained his own, had it
not been for the extraordinary and unexplained
treachery of Palmer’s own friend, Charles Bonnor,
whom he had provided with a splendid post at
the General Post Office. This man suddenly
launched a pamphlet in which he accused his
benefactor of delaying the London post in order
to create popular demands for reforms Palmer
himself desired to introduce, reforms that would
place him in a position of higher authority. The
Postmasters-General received the publication of
this pamphlet with a well-simulated amazement,
but the suspicion that they had themselves induced
Bonnor to perform the part of Judas is inevitable,
and is deepened by their subsequent action.
Palmer, of course, suspended Bonnor, whereupon
they asked the reason, and on Palmer refusing
to give an explanation that must have been wholly
unnecessary in fact, if not in actual form, they
reinstated the man. Nay, more, when Bonnor
repaired to my lords with the news that Palmer
had refused to reinstate him, and had, in fact,
ordered him with threats off the premises, they
consented to read and to show to Pitt the private
and confidential correspondence he had brought
with him, addressed by Palmer to his former
friend during a series of years, and containing not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
a little compromising matter, proving how Palmer
had been steadily bent on asserting his own
authority and on denying that of the Postmasters-General.</p>

<span class="fright"><i>From the engraving after George Robertson.</i></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>The whole pitiful story is at bottom an indictment
of the figurehead in public life; an exposure
of the hoary custom of appointing political and
ornamental heads to the overlordship of executive
departments really ruled by permanent officials.
My lords came and went as party fortunes willed.
Palmer had officially no politics; all he desired
was to perfect his already successful plan. Other
Postmasters-General would have been content
with their figureheadship, and have danced like
any other Governmental puppets to the pulling of
official strings; but Palmer’s overlords declined to
do anything of the sort, and if they could not
organise or originate, found it at least possible to
meddle and veto.</p>

<p>Palmer, ready at most times to do anything—to
travel many miles, to expend his highly nervous
energies in any other way than by letter-writing,
made this one irretrievable blunder of a generous-minded
man. He was accustomed to unburden
himself on paper to the friend who already owed
everything to him—and who by natural consequence
hated him for it—and by so doing was,
as we perceive, in the end undone.</p>

<p>The Postmasters-General were the sole eventual
gainers by Bonnor’s incredible perfidy, for that
creature, by rare poetic justice, died at last in
misery and want.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
When at length they succeeded in obtaining
another interview with Pitt and disclosed these
letters, there was, of course, an end of Palmer’s
official career. But it was sorely against his will
that the Great Commoner left the Comptroller-General
to his fate. He saw that a great deal of
the animus shown against him by my lords was
due to their sense of the enormity of a person of
his rank withstanding not merely Postmasters-General,
but Postmasters-General who were also
peers of the realm. He saw, too, that a peer
with the dignity of his caste offended can descend
to more despicable depths to avenge himself than
a mere untitled person would plumb. The pity
is that even Pitt could not ignore letters written
in confidence and treacherously disclosed.</p>

<p>But, although Palmer was left to the mercy
of his enemies, who instantly dismissed him, he
did not go without acknowledgment. His salary
and commission had by now reached £3,000 a year,
and this sum Pitt continued to him as a pension
from 1792, the date of his dismissal.</p>

<p>Palmer was now fifty years of age, and in his
prime. He naturally was not content with this
settlement, and moved the whole influential world
to aid him, petitioning the House of Commons,
and at length securing a committee to investigate
his case. Sheridan, moving the appointment of
this body, urged Palmer’s claims with generous
eloquence. He described how the reformer had
formed the plan of a mail-coach service, and had
introduced it to the notice of the Government,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
entering into an agreement to receive a percentage
in the event of success, and not one shilling if it
proved a failure. “None but an enthusiast,” he
declared, “could have formed such a plan; none
but an enthusiast could have carried it into
execution; and I am confident that no man in
this country or any other could have done it but
that very individual, John Palmer.”</p>

  <div class="caption smaller">ONE OF THREE MAIL-COACH HALFPENNIES STRUCK
AT BATH, 1797.</div></div>

<p>The report of this committee, recommending
an increased pension or a grant, was not adopted;
but in 1801
Palmer himself
entered
Parliament
and fought
his own
battles. He
printed and
circulated
among the
members and
in other circles a statement of his case, and in
the course of eight years expended no less a sum
than £13,000 in appeals for justice—in vain, and
it was left for his eldest son, Colonel Charles
Palmer, who succeeded him in the representation
of Bath in 1808, to at last fight the question
to a victorious issue. In 1813 he secured for his
father an award of £50,000, and the continuance
during his life of the commission on Post Office
receipts originally agreed upon.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Palmer had been variously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
honoured. Gainsborough, his neighbour at Royal
Circus, Bath, painted his portrait; Glasgow
merchants, members of the Chamber of Commerce
in that city, had as early as 1789 presented him
with a silver loving-cup, “as an acknowledgment
of the benefits resulting from his plan to the
trade and commerce of this kingdom”; and in
1797 three “mail-coach halfpennies” were struck
by some now unknown admirer. They bear on
the obverse a mail-coach, and on the reverse an
inscription to him “as a token of gratitude for
benefits received” from his system. A third
tribute was the painting by George Robertson,
engraved by James Fittler, and inscribed, curiously,
to him as Comptroller-General, in 1803,
eleven years after he had ceased to hold that
position. He also received the freedom of eighteen
cities and towns in recognition of his public
services, was Mayor of Bath in 1796 and 1801,
and represented that city in the four Parliaments
of 1801, 1802, 1806, and 1807. He died at
Brighton in 1818, in his seventy-sixth year. His
body was conveyed to Bath and laid in the Abbey
Church; but no monument marks the spot, and
it is only recently that his residence at Royal
Circus, and his birthplace in his native city, have
been identified to the wayfarer by inscribed
tablets.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>JOHN PALMER IN HIS 75TH YEAR.
<span class="fright"><i>From an etching by the Hon. Martha Jervis.</i></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>The very earliest mail-coaches were ill made,
and were continually breaking down. Although
the coaches themselves were supplied by the
contractors, and the Post Office was not concerned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
in their cost, it was very closely interested in
their efficiency; and so, early in 1787, Palmer
had already represented to the contractors that
the mails must be conveyed by more reliable
coaches.</p>

<p>“The Comptroller-General,” he wrote to one
contractor, “has to complain not only of the
quality of the horses employed on the Bristol Mail,
but as well of their harness and the accoutrements
in use, whose defects have several times delayed
the Bath and Bristol and London letters, and have
even led to the conveyance being overset, to the
imminent peril of the passengers. Instructions
have been issued by the Comptroller for new sets
of harness to be supplied to the several coaches in
use on this road, for which accounts will be sent
you by the harness-makers. Mr. Palmer has also
under consideration, for the contractors’ use, a
new-invented coach.”</p>

<p>This was a truly imperial way of remedying
gross dereliction on the contractors’ part, but it
had its effect in this and other instances, for it
may be presumed that the harness-makers thus
officially selected to replace the contractors’
ancient assortments of worm-eaten leather and
cord were not the cheapest in the trade, and that
those contractors very soon awoke to the fact that
it would be more economical in future to provide
new harness of their own free will, and from their
own harness-makers, than under compulsion.</p>

<p>In respect of the type of coaches, as well as of
their equipment in minor details, Palmer sternly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
resolved to impose thorough efficiency. As he
was very well assured that their defects arose
from the cheese-paring policy of the contractors
themselves, he decided that the Post Office
must have a voice in the selection of the
coaches, and, having discovered what he considered
a suitable build, made it a condition of the service
that it should be used. This officially-approved
new type was a “patent coach” by one Besant.
The contractors had no choice in the matter.
Palmer, the autocrat, had seen that Besant’s
coaches were good, and willed it that they should
use none others, and so to that fortunate patentee
they were obliged to resort. He entered into
partnership with Vidler, a practical coachbuilder;
and thus at Millbank, Westminster, was established
that mail-coach manufactory which for
forty years supplied the mail-coaches to the mail-contractors.
Besant and Vidler’s terms were
twopence-halfpenny a double mile. For this price
the coaches were hired out to the contractors and
kept in repair. The practice was for Vidler’s men
to take over the mail-coaches after they had
entered the General Post Office in the morning,
on the completion of their up journeys, and to
drive them to Millbank, where they were cleaned
and greased, and delivered to the various contractors’
coach-yards in the afternoon.</p>

<p>On December 2nd, 1791, Besant died. He
was, we are told, “an honest, worthy man, and
the mechanical world sustains a great loss by his
death. His ingenuity was in various instances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
sanctioned by the Society of Arts, many of whose
premiums were awarded to him.”</p>

<p>However that may have been, and although
to Palmer the patent coach of Besant may have
seemed altogether admirable, there were many
who condemned it and its patent springs. It is
apparently one of this type that is pictured by
Dalgety in his print of St. George’s Circus, dated
1797. It is curious and interesting, as showing
a transition between the old type of coach and a
style yet to come. The fore boot is of the old
detached type, but the wickerwork basket behind
is discarded, and a hind boot may be observed,
framed to the body. The coach is hung very
high, and suspended at the back from iron or steel
arms of the pump-handle kind. This seems to be
the type criticised so severely by Matthew Boulton,
himself an engineer, in 1798, when, describing a
mail-coach trip from London to Exeter, he roundly
condemned the patent <span class="locked">springs:—</span></p>

<p>“I had the most disagreeable journey I ever
experienced the night after I left you, owing to
the new improved patent coach, a vehicle loaded
with iron trappings and the greatest complication
of unmechanical contrivances jumbled together,
that I have ever witnessed. The coach swings
sideways, with a sickly sway, without any vertical
spring; the point of suspense bearing upon an
arch called a spring, though it is nothing of
the sort. The severity of the jolting occasioned
me such disorder that I was obliged to stop at
Axminster and go to bed very ill. However, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
was able to proceed next day in a post-chaise.
The landlady in the ‘London Inn’ at Exeter
assured me that the passengers who arrived every
night were in general so ill that they were obliged
to go supperless to bed; and unless they go back
to the old-fashioned coach, hung a little lower,
the mail-coaches will lose all their custom.”</p>

<p>Some debated points respecting the early mails
are cleared up in a series of replies by Palmer
to questions put by the French Post Office in
1791, respecting the English mail-coach system.
“What,” asks M. de Richebourg, “is a Mail-coach?”
and among other details we learn that
“it is constructed to carry four Inside Passengers
only, and One Outside Passenger, who rides with
the Coachman.” Here we perceive the beginning
of the outsides.</p>

<p>Then the question is asked: “When there
are no Travellers on the Mail-coaches, do they
put-to the same number of Horses as when there
are?” To this the answer was: “They are all
drove with four Horses, sometimes, in Snow and
very bad weather, with Six;—never less than four,
whether they have Passengers or not.” This
disposes of the statements made that the early
mails were two-horsed.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII" class="vspace">CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="subhead">THE NINETEENTH CENTURY: 1800–1824</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">The</span> period at which this chapter begins is that
when outside passengers were first enabled to ride
on the roofs of coaches without incurring the
imminent hazard of being thrown off whenever
their vigilance and their anxious grip were relaxed.
It was about 1800 that fore and hind boots,
framed to the body of the coach, became general,
thus affording foothold to the outsides. Mail-coaches
were not the cause of this change, for
they originally carried no passengers on the roof.</p>

<p>We cannot fix the exact date of this improvement,
and may suppose that, in common with
every other innovation, it was gradual, and only
introduced when new coaches became necessary on
the various routes. The immediate result was to
democratise coach-travelling. Exclusive insides,
who once with disgust observed the occasional
soldier or sailor dangling his legs in the windows,
now were obliged to put up with a set of cheap
travellers who, if they did no longer so dangle
their common legs, being provided with seats and
footholds, were always to be found on the roof,
laughing and talking loudly, enjoying themselves
in the elementary and vociferous way only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
possible to low persons, and disturbing the genteel
reflections of the insides. Let us pity the sorrows
of those superior travellers, unwillingly conscious
of those stamping, noisy, low-down creatures on
the roof!</p>

<p>The revulsion of those sensitive persons led to
the establishment of a superior class of coach,
carrying insides only; and accordingly, we find the
original improvement of seats on the roof bringing
far-reaching consequences in its train. While
democratising coaches, it at the same time
necessitated another class, and thus directly
brought about a numerical increase. The exclusive
were thus enabled to keep their exclusiveness
by going in such conveyances as that
announced in the advertising columns of the
high-class <span class="locked">papers:—</span></p>

  <div class="caption"><p>MRS. BUNDLE IN A RAGE; OR, TOO LATE FOR THE STAGE.<br />
<span class="fright"><i>After Rowlandson, 1809.</i></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>The period now under consideration was in
other ways a very great and progressive one. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
this space of twenty-five years were included the
two most significant advances in the whole history
of the road—the introduction about 1805 of
springs under the driving-box, and the shortening
of the stages. Without either of them, the
acceleration that resulted in the Golden Age of
coaching, beginning in 1825, would have been
impossible.</p>

<p>The placing of springs under the driving-box
was due to the suggestion of John Warde, earliest
of the coaching amateurs, who had been taught
the art of driving a stage-coach by Jack Bailey,
a famed coachman on the old “Prince of Wales,”
between London and Birmingham. He had found
the jolting received directly from the axle an
intolerable infliction on a long drive, and urged
coach-proprietors to provide springs. Said “Mr.
Wilkins of the ‘Balloon’”—a character in
Nimrod’s <i>Life of a Sportsman</i>—“they do say they
are going to put the boxes of all stage-coaches on
springs, but Heaven knows when that will be—not
in my time, I fear. Our people say it
won’t do; we shall go to sleep on them. No
danger of a man doing that now, even if he should
be a bit overtaken with drink.” Under these
circumstances there was, as Mr. Wilkins went on
to show, “a great deal of <em>hart</em> in sitting on a
coach-box,” as well as driving four horses.
“Your body must go with the swing of the box,
and let your lines (loins, he meant) be as lissom as
you can. It would kill a man in a week to drive
as far as I do, if he did not do as I say.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
When it became clear to coach-proprietors that
a coachman could drive a longer distance when
his body was not racked so intolerably, they
provided springs, and risked the remote chance of
coachmen going to sleep on the box.</p>

<p>Another reform, humane to the horses and
directly productive of increased speed and efficiency
on the road, was the introduction of shorter
stages. From those almost incredible times when
a coach went from end to end of a long trip and
returned with the same team, to those when the
stages were twenty miles long constituted, no
doubt, a great advance; but that was by this time
no longer sufficient. The mail stages, as we have
seen, rarely at the earliest times exceeded ten
miles, and were often much less. The mails also
travelled at night, a thing the stage-coaches did
not in the old times dare attempt. In the early
days of Pennant, and other chroniclers contemporary
with him, the coaches inned every evening.
None dared travel when the sun had set and
darkness brooded over the land, for there were not
only the highwaymen to be feared—and they still
continued to increase—but the badness of the
roads had constituted a danger even more dreaded.
Now, however, roads—thanks to Post Office
insistence—were greatly improved; and if the
mails could go through the darkness, why not
also the stages? Coincident with these things,
great minds perceived that by changing horses
every ten miles or so, and coachmen at intervals,
a coach might, in the first place, be made to go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
much faster, and secondly, might put into twenty-four
hours of continuous running what had
formerly been the work of three days. It is
obviously easy to go over a hundred miles in the
twenty-four hours even if you only go five miles
in every hour. These great truths once perceived
and acted upon, the coaching world was revolutionised.</p>

<div id="ip_187" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 36.5em;">

  <div class="caption"><p class="in2">THE SHEFFIELD COACH, ABOUT 1827.
<span class="fright"><i>From a contemporary painting.</i></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>No longer did coaching announcements propose
to perform journeys in so many hours <em>if the roads
were good</em>. They boldly promised that they would
complete their course by a certain time, and
altogether disregarded contingencies. By this
time the “God-permits” had also become things
of the past, and no proprietor was so old-fashioned
as to announce that his coach would set out or
arrive, “God permitting,” as aforetime had been
the cautious or pious proviso. They now
“started” instead of “setting out,” and arrived,
as an irreverent wag observed, “God willing,
or not.”</p>

<p>In fine, the world was made to go according to
time-tables, and much faster than of old. Coaches
actually, as an ordinary everyday thing, went at a
quicker pace than an able-bodied man could walk,
and it was no longer possible for a weary traveller
when offered a lift, to decline with the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bonâ-fide</i>
excuse that he was in a hurry; and so, continuing
afoot, to arrive before the coach. Fielding shows
us Parson Adams outwalking the coach, about
1745; but in this era the passengers just too late
for the stage could by no means hope to catch it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
up. Why, it commonly went at eight miles an
hour, and often nine! Thus we see Rowlandson’s
anxious travellers, unable to attract the attention
of the coach in front of them and equally unable to
overtake it, left lamenting.</p>

<p>This, too, was the age of increased competition,
when a continuous smartening-up alone kept
some of the old-stagers going. Thus, in 1805,
when three coaches left London every day for
Sheffield, the quickest took over thirty hours. In
1821 it left the “Angel,” Angel Street, St. Martin’s-le-Grand,
at 3.30 p.m., and arrived at Sheffield at
8 the next evening,—163¼ miles in 28½ hours, or
at the rate of 5¾ miles an hour, including stops.
In 1824 it started an hour later and arrived at the
same hour as before; and in 1827 was expedited
by another half-hour. That was very poor
travelling, and it is not surprising that after 1827
it is heard of no more. More strenuous rivals
usurped the route.</p>

<p>Here we see that coach drawn up in front of a
wayside hostelry,—the “Bull’s Head”—at some
unnamed spot. Let us not criticise the drawing
of it too narrowly, for the painting whence this
illustration was engraved was the work of the
coachman, Alfred Elliot. He was coachman first,
and artist afterwards.</p>

<p>Another result of competition was the gorgeous
livery a coach on a hotly contested route would
assume, and the number of places it would pretend
to serve. In the illustration of the “Express”
London and Birmingham coach—represented in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
the act of leaving the “Hen and Chickens,” New
Street, Birmingham, and reproduced from a
curious contemporary painting executed on sheet
tin—an extraordinary number of place-names are
seen; some those of towns this coach could not
possibly have served. The explanation is that the
“Express” made connections with other routes and
booked passengers for them, whom they set down
at ascertained points to wait for the connecting
coach. This in itself, an early attempt at the
through booking and junction system obtaining on
railways, is evidence of the progress made towards
exact time-keeping in this era.</p>

<p>De Quincey, as a mail-passenger, has a
scornful passage reflecting upon the gold and
colour that adorned these stage-coaches, which,
being furiously competitive, could not afford to be
quiet and plain, like the mails. “A tawdry thing
from Birmingham,” was his verdict upon the
“Tally-Ho” or “Highflyer,” that overtook the
Holyhead Mail between Shrewsbury and Oswestry.
“All flaunting with green and gold,” it came up
alongside. “What a contrast with our royal
simplicity of form and colour is this plebeian
wretch, with as much writing and painting on
its sprawling flanks as would have puzzled a
decipherer from the tombs of Luxor!” Precisely
the same things might be said of omnibuses in our
own days.</p>

<span class="subhead">COACH LEGISLATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">“The</span> law,” said Mr. Bumble, “is a hass!” and
scarcely ever has it appeared more asinine than in
its dealings with the roads and road-traffic. Legislative
traffic restrictions were very early introduced,
originally on behalf of the highways; and not until
the coaching age was well advanced did it appear
necessary to intervene with enactments protecting
the passengers as well as the road surface. There
was perhaps no necessity to legislate against reckless
driving in the early days of coaching; for,
with the singularly bad state of the roads, the
clumsy build of the original vehicles, and the
exhaustion of the teams that drew them great
distances without a change, it would have passed
the wit of man to be a charioteer with the dashing
methods attributed to Jehu, that Biblical hero,
the son of Nimshi, who, we are told, “drove
furiously.”</p>

<p>The first restrictions to be put in force were
those levelled against the heavy road-traffic of
the time of James I. By them, four-wheeled
carts and waggons were, in 1622, absolutely prohibited,
and loads above 20 cwt. forbidden: “No<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
carrier or other person whatsoever shall travel
with any wain, cart, or carriage with more than
two wheels, nor above the weight of twenty
hundred, nor shall draw any wain, cart, or carriage
with more than five horses at once.” This
was confirmed in 1629. It seems an arbitrary and
merely freakish act, thus to interfere with the
traffic of the roads; but we must remember what
those roads were like, and consider that our
ancestors were not irrational puppets, but living,
breathing, and reasoning men, whose doings, when
considered in relation with the times, the limitations
that obscured their view, and the disabilities
that surrounded them, were eminently logical.
It is not easy to be wiser than one’s generation,
and those who are have generally been accounted
geniuses by later ages and madmen by their
contemporaries. Even when ideas are of the
enlightened kind, they are not readily to be applied
when greatly in advance of their era; for stubborn
facts, difficult to remove or improve away, commonly
delay the practical application of the most
brilliant theories. If a seventeenth-century
MacAdam had arisen to preach the gospel of good
roads, instead of repressive regulations for bad
ones, he would still have had to overcome the
difficulty of finding road-metal in districts far
removed from stone; and how he would or could
have surmounted that impediment when all roads
were bad and the transport of materials from a
distance expensive and tedious, we will leave the
reader to determine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
To look upon our forbears, therefore, as though
they were strange creatures whose movements
were not governed by as much common sense as
our own would be absurd.</p>

<p>The reason for the regulations proclaimed in
1622 and again in 1629 was set forth in the statement
that the four-wheeled waggons used up to
that time had, with their excessive burdens, so
galled the highways and the very foundations of
bridges that they had become common nuisances.</p>

<p>The carriers and drovers and their kind were,
in 1627, forbidden to travel on Sunday, under a
penalty of 20<i>s.</i> By the terms of this Act,
which began by stating that “the Lord’s Day,
commonly called Sunday,” was “much broken
and profaned by carriers, waggoners, carters, wainmen,
butchers, and drovers of cattle, to the great
dishonour of God and reproach of religion,” any
of these persons travelling or causing their servants
to travel or come to their inns on Sundays could
be convicted on the evidence of witnesses, or on
their own confession, at any time up to six months
after the commission of the offence, and the magistrates
could at their discretion award one-third of
the penalty to the informer and two-thirds to the
poor of the parish. Thus early did the informer,
who was in later years to play so important a part,
come upon the scene. The notion of a conscious-stricken
carrier or drover confessing to the heinous
crime of travelling on Sunday is amusing.</p>

<p>The next intervention was that of the Sunday
Trading Act of 1676, a Puritanical measure whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
enactment in the licentious reign of Charles II.
is still the wonder of students of social history.
Had it been a measure originating with the
Commonwealth, its appearance in the statute
book could be readily explained, but, as matters
stand, we are reduced to assuming that, although
King, Court and Society might be vicious, yet
Parliament, and England as a whole, were still
deeply tinged with strict Sabbatarian sentiments.
The Act forbade the sale or exposing for
sale of any wares of merchandise whatsoever on
the Sabbath day. Drovers, waggoners, horse-coursers,
butchers and higglers were not to come
to their inns on Sundays, under a penalty of
20<i>s.</i>; and no work, except works of necessity
and charity, was to be undertaken. The service in
private families and at inns was allowed, and meat
might be dressed on that day, and milk cried before
9 a.m. or after 4 p.m. But plying for hire and
travelling were not then considered necessary on
that day, and so enjoyed no special exemption.
The cooking of meat and the selling of milk only
enjoyed this Sunday franchise because milk and
meat are perishable. It was this consideration that,
in 1690, brought about an amendment by which
the crying of that exceptionally perishable fish,
mackerel, was legalised on the Sabbath.</p>

<p>Not a wheel wagged, therefore, on Sundays in
the early days of coaching, and the tradition
against Sunday travel long outlasted the legal disability;
so that although mail-coaches were never
a Sabbatarian institution, the stage-coaches on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
that day were always few while coaching lasted.
The tradition was weaker on the Brighton Road
than elsewhere. That was a fashionable road, and
fashion has ever been irreligious, leaving the
people outside its ranks to be the bulwarks of the
Seventh Day. Thus we find the first Sunday
coach between London and Brighton established
in 1792.</p>

<p>The Sunday Trading Act has never been
wholly repealed, and it is still possible for sour
and malignant persons to intervene, under the
ready cloak of religious and Sabbatarian feeling,
and to lay information against shopkeepers who
open on Sundays, and so cause the tobacconists,
the hairdressers and newsagents, who commonly
continue their business on that day, to be summoned
and fined for every such offence. The Act
only generally comprehended hackney-coaches,
but that term included the stages, which were
thus penalised until 1710, when, by the 9th of
Anne, c. 23, hackney-coachmen and chairmen
might ply.</p>

<p>It is a curious and noteworthy point about this
obsolescent Act that when an information is laid
the police have no optional course. They must
issue a summons, while the magistrates are bound
to fine offenders on their being convicted. It
depends, however, upon the character and the
prejudices of the bench whether the penalty may
be a merely nominal one, carrying an implied
disapproval of the informer’s action, or the full
statutory fine of 5<i>s.</i> and costs. We here observe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
the ill which it is still possible for the common
informer to work, but the great days of these
gentry are gone.</p>

<p>Parliament, never tired of legislating for roads
and vehicles, produced in course of time a strange
and bewildering medley of laws, often contradictory
of one another. Among these Acts, those for
the regulation of waggons were the most numerous.
An early curiosity of the statute book in this
connection is the Act of Charles II. forbidding
carters and waggoners to drive six or more horses
tandem. Already, it appears, the old prohibition of
four-wheeled carts or wains, in 1622 and 1629, was
obsolete. Then followed an Act of William III.
expressly forbidding waggon-horses being yoked in
pairs; but another of the same reign withdrew this
prohibition, and, in allowing pairs, limited the team
to eight animals. In the succeeding reign of
Anne this limit was reduced to six in pairs,
except uphill, when additional horses might be
yoked on. The prohibition of horses going abreast
points to the extreme narrowness of the roads in
many parts of the country at that time, just as its
supersession by the Act permitting pairs would
appear to be a result of road-widening.</p>

<p>To make a digest of this whole series of enactments
and the clauses repealed and re-enacted
would not only tax the acumen and industry of a
Parliamentary lawyer, but the result would be
tedious. Let us, then, pass to the Act called, in
Parliamentary jargon, “24th George II., c. 43.”
This came into operation July 1st, 1752, and took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
off one of the six horses allowed to waggons by
the Parliament of Queen Anne. No carriage or
waggon drawn by more than five horses, except
up steep hills, was permitted to pass through any
toll-gate or toll-bar, unless the sum of twenty
shillings over and above the usual tolls was paid;
and any person taking off any horse from such
vehicle, with intent to avoid the payment of the
additional toll, was, on conviction of the offence,
to forfeit £5 to the informer, who was given the
right to levy a distress on the offender’s goods if
he could not recover the penalty in any other way.
At the same time, no waggon was to pass which
weighed, with its contents, more than three tons;
and weighing engines were to be provided by
turnpike trustees, to see that the law was not
infringed. This was a very determined Act, but
those who drew it were very well satisfied that,
considering the comparatively few roads already
turnpiked, its meshes could not be made small
enough to catch those offenders who constantly
carried weights up to five tons upon the roads
and yoked up ten or twelve horses to drag the
enormous load. It was obvious that the only thing
the waggoners had to do in order to evade the law
was—risking the chance of finding the way impassable—to
turn aside on nearing a turnpike and to
make a circuit along parish roads where no toll-houses
existed. Accordingly, those who framed
the Act inserted what was intended to be a very
alarming and altogether disabling clause. It was
made an unlawful act to drive off in this manner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
into adjacent roads for the purpose of avoiding
toll, and a penalty was set up for so doing. This
was the forfeiting of one horse (not being the shaft
or thill horse) and “all his gear and accoutrements.”
This phrase for harness strikes one as
being magnificent, and almost raises the sturdy
Suffolk “Punch” or the Lincolnshire carthorse to
the status of a military hero.</p>

<p>No enforcement of this penalty can be found,
but it is not to be supposed that it was never made,
although, to be sure, the clause had loopholes sufficiently
wide for the traditional coach-and-six to be
easily driven through. Apart from the questionable
legality of forbidding common roads to traffic,
it would have needed no very able lawyer to successfully
defend an offender charged with being
on a bye-route “with intent to defraud” the tolls.
Half a dozen sufficient explanations would have
been ready. The waggoner might have missed
his way; it might have been his best way—and
so forth.</p>

<p>This Act, and others of like nature, especially
exempted certain classes of waggons and carts,
particularly agricultural vehicles; while his
Majesty’s War Office and military commanders
might use waggons carrying any weight they
thought proper and drawn by as many horses as
might be thought necessary. The law was, in
fact, framed to protect the roads against traders,
who were thought to be profiting greatly by the
growth of manufactures and not contributing
sufficiently to the upkeep of the roads which it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
was thought their excessive loads did much to
wear out. The Acts had force in the country
generally, but London and a radius from twenty-five
to thirty miles were usually excepted.</p>

<p>A very lengthy and severe General Turnpike
Act, embodying some of the provisions already
detailed, with many new ones, was that of 1766.
Preambles to Acts of Parliament are generally
exaggerated statements of the necessities that
procured the passing of the enactments to which
they sometimes afford astonishing prefaces. They
are, indeed, officially so recognised, and lawyers
accordingly describe them as “common form.”
The preamble, however, to the Act of 1766 was
an exact statement of affairs, and in saying that
“the laws for the general regulation of turnpike
roads are very numerous and in some respects
ineffectual,” it merely set forth a commonplace
of the time.</p>

<p>For a number of years before the passing of
this measure, lengthy and heated controversies
had arisen on the subject of waggons and roads,
and as a result it was generally conceded that
wheels with narrow tyres and heavy loads cut
up the highways into ruts, while broad wheels
so distributed the weight that they greatly
minimised that evil, or even, if they were broad
enough, rolled the surface into a better condition
than it was in before their passing. Inventive
minds, rioting with theories not perfectly tested,
went to extremes and produced extraordinary
waggons with heavy iron rollers instead of wheels,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
which would certainly have flattened out the most
rugged of roads had it been possible for horses
to have moved the enormous weight. As a result
of much trial, the stage-waggons of the time were
constructed with wheels whose breadth ranged
from six to nine inches, and such vehicles enjoyed
a remission of extraordinary toll in proportion
to those measurements. From 1766, then, four-wheeled
waggons weighing over three tons, with
wheels less than nine inches in breadth, paid
20<i>s.</i> over and above the ordinary toll; all over
six tons, irrespective of wheels, 20<i>s.</i>; and two-wheeled
carts over three tons, 20<i>s.</i>; while waggons
and carts so constructed with regard to long and
short axletrees to front and hind wheels that,
in conjunction with the breadth of their wheels,
they rolled a track of not less than sixteen inches
on either side, paid only half of the ordinary toll
levied upon wagons with a nine-inch breadth of
wheel. These provisions may perhaps seem a
little complicated, but they were a great deal
more so in actual working, for their chance of
being always understood and fairly applied was
small when administered by country pike-keepers.</p>

<p>The maximum length and width of waggons
was specified by this Act, which declared it to be
unlawful for any but timber-waggons to be of
greater breadth than four feet six inches between
the axletrees, or of a greater length than nine feet
from the centre of fore wheels to that of the hind
ones. No broad-wheeled waggon was to be drawn
by more than eight horses, or two-wheeled carts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
by more than five, in pairs; and narrow-wheeled
waggons were not allowed more than four. A
penalty of 20<i>s.</i> was indicated for harnessing an
extra horse, in addition to the horse being confiscated.
Additional horses might be used when
the roads were covered with snow or ice, and it
was left to the discretion of turnpike trustees to
allow extra horses on steep hills, in which cases
any number up to ten might be used for four-wheeled
waggons, or up to six for two-wheeled;
but trustees were to carefully specify those hills
on which this indulgence was granted. Steep
hills, consequently, for many years afterwards
were generally seen with notices beside the road,
where the horses might be attached. A post at
the bottom announced in large letters, “Put On,”
and another, at the top, “Take Off.”</p>

<p>Narrow-wheeled waggons were not to be drawn
by pairs. Drag-irons or slippers to be flat, not
rounded; penalty 40<i>s.</i> The owner’s name and
place of abode were to be painted on the most
conspicuous part of each waggon or cart, with
the words “<span class="smcap">Common Stage-Waggon</span>,” or cart, as
the case might be. It was this enactment that
for many years afterwards gave their characteristic
appearance to the old stage-waggons, for the
most conspicuous place on them was undoubtedly
the canvas tilt, which was always painted as the
Act directed, in very large lettering.</p>

<p>The Act was lavish with its pains and penalties.
For using a waggon with a false name, or without
a name, 40<i>s.</i> was the price. The driver of any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
waggon with wheels not constructed according
to law, or drawn by more horses than authorised,
could be imprisoned, and powers were given to
any person to apprehend any driver in such cases.
If a driver, on coming to a toll-gate, unharnessed
any horses or unloaded any part of his load with
intent to deceive or defraud the turnpike authorities,
he forfeited £5; while the owner paid the
same sum in cases where waggons were loaded
to excess, and the driver became liable to be
committed for one month to a house of correction.</p>

<p>Among the clauses of this and other Acts it
is especially forbidden to waggoners to sit in, or
drive from, their waggons. They must either
walk or ride beside them. They had, indeed,
generally done so, as the portrait of old Hobson,
on horseback, shows us, or the pictures and narratives
of old road life by contemporary artists and
writers sufficiently prove; but as the Acts especially
decree that waggoners were not to ride on
the waggons, the reason being that from such a
position they could not maintain sufficient control
over their horses, some of them must have done
so, and perhaps have fallen asleep and so caused
accidents, just as the slumbering carters and
waggoners on their way to and from Covent
Garden Market do now.</p>

<p>It now became the turn of the coaches to
attract the attention of legislators. They obtained
this doubtful favour because it had just occurred
to the Revenue officials that, owing to the increased
number of coaches running, and the larger number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
of persons resorting to them, the duty on post-horses
had not grown at its accustomed rate. The
remedy ready to hand was a Stamp Office duty on
stage-coaches, which was accordingly introduced
in 1776, and four-wheeled coaches paid £5 per
annum. The Revenue “vampires,” as the coach-proprietors
called them, turned again to this
new source of income, and in 1783 levied a duty
of a halfpenny a mile run by every stage-coach.
Further measures were introduced two years later,
when the duties were revised, and four-wheeled
and two-wheeled coaches alike paid a five-shilling
annual license, and a duty of a penny a mile.
From this express inclusion of two-wheeled coaches,
it would seem that some vehicles of that nature
had been introduced to evade the previous duty;
but coaching history is silent on the subject. The
duty of a penny a mile was to be paid monthly,
and seven days’ notice to be given of any coach
being discontinued.</p>

<p>So far the legislature had only taken notice of
coaches when new sources of revenue were being
sought; but an eye was already upon their doings,
an eye that had noted the increasing accidents, due
to overloading, reckless driving, and a variety of
other causes. It was not an official eye that thus
ranged over the roads of the kingdom and marked
the broken limbs and contusions of the lieges,
acquired by falling from the roofs of coaches, by
collisions and upsets: it was the stern gaze, indeed,
of one Richard Gamon, a private member of Parliament,
who in 1788, in the face of much opposition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
and ridicule, brought in a Bill to regulate stage-coaches.
It is sad to think that even those who
travelled largely by coach, whom Mr. Gamon
desired to protect, made fun of his efforts, and,
when his Bill at first failed to pass, rejoiced as
greatly in the prospect of a continued free trade
in broken necks and legs as ever the coach-proprietors
themselves could have done. Some of
this wit was very cheap stuff indeed. It largely
consisted of torturing Mr. Gamon’s name into
“Gammon,” and that done, the rest was easy.
A morning newspaper found it possible to write
<span class="locked">thus:—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Whene’er a loaded stage drives by<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With more than it should draw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We view the outside group, and cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“That’s contrary to law.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But all the folks who clamour thus<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Are totally mistaken,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Gammon’s Bill did never pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So coachmen saved their bacon.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Richard Gamon was a member for Winchester
in five several Parliaments. He had been a commissioner
for salt duties, but resigned that office
to enter the House. He was created a baronet in
July, 1795, and died, aged sixty-nine, April 9th,
1818. His Act was not forgotten, for in his
obituary notice it is duly stated that “with
him originated that useful and humane law for
regulating the number of outside passengers on
stage-coaches.”</p>

<p>What with public ridicule of his original Bill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
and the petition of the coach-proprietors against it,
Mr. Gamon and his legislative effort had, in one
way and another, a stirring time. But in the same
year he saw it pass into an Act, and two years
later he procured an amended and stricter statute.
So ridicule does not always kill.</p>

<p>It therefore became law that stage-coaches
were not to carry more than six passengers on the
roof or more than two on the box in addition to
the coachman. For every passenger in excess the
coachman was liable to a penalty of 40<i>s.</i>, and if he
was proprietor, or part proprietor, this penalty was
raised to £4. The amended Act very materially
altered this regulation. Coaches drawn by three
or more horses were allowed only one passenger on
the box and four on the roof, and those with fewer
than three horses, one passenger on the box and
three on the roof. If the pair-horse coaches did
not travel farther than twenty-five miles from
London, they might carry an additional passenger
on the roof. The penalty for carrying excess
passengers was severe, and ingeniously contrived
in order to wholly suppress the practice. It was
5s. each for every supernumerary passenger, to be
paid to the toll-keeper at every turnpike gate.
This was a sure method, for an excess number
would be instantly detected by pike-men eager for
a chance to add to their income. The penalty for
fraudulently setting down a passenger near a turnpike
gate, and taking him up on the other side,
with intent to evade this regulation, was of a
different kind, but of equal severity. It was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
term of imprisonment, of not less than fourteen
days or more than a month. The names of the
coach proprietors were to be painted in legible
characters on the doors of all the coaches, with the
exception of the mails.</p>

<p>One section of the Acts of 1788 and 1790 had a
special significance. It forbade coachmen permitting
other persons to drive, under a penalty of
from 40<i>s.</i> to £5. The amateur whip, of whom
later writers complained so bitterly, had evidently
already been taking coaching lessons on the road,
with disastrous results. The practice was not
stopped by the Acts or the penalty, for in 1811 the
prohibition was renewed, and the fine raised. It
was then to be anything between £5 and £10, at
the discretion of the magistrates.</p>

<p>Coachmen were viewed all round, as it were,
and their failings separately ticked off and provided
against. No coachman was to leave his box without
reasonable cause or occasion, or for an unnecessary
length of time. Furious driving now being
physically possible, and frequently indulged in,
was legislated for, together with any negligence or
misconduct resulting in the overturning of a coach
or the endangering of passengers. A guard of a
stage-coach who should fire off his piece unnecessarily,
or for other than defensive purposes, on the
road or in any town, forfeited 20<i>s.</i>, a penalty
enlarged to £5 in 1811, and including mail-guards.</p>

<p>The Act of 1806, introducing itself by stating
that previous Acts were ineffectual and insufficient,
started off by repealing the provisions of the older<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
ones, allowing only six outsides for four-horse
coaches. They might now carry twelve outsides
in summer and ten in winter, including the guard,
but exclusive of coachman. In 1811 the number
was reduced to ten throughout the year. The
positions of the outsides were specified—one passenger
on the box with the coachman, three in
front of the roof, the remainder behind. Coaches
with only two or three horses now carried five
outsides, exclusive of the coachman; but “all
stages called long coaches, or double-bodied
coaches” might carry eight outsides, exclusive
of coachman, but including the guard. Children
in arms or under seven years of age were not to be
counted, unless there were more than one, when
two were to be counted as one passenger, and
so on.</p>

<p>A curious section, bearing upon and corroborating
what De Quincey and others have written
upon the disdain and contempt of the insides for
the outsides, is that which forbade any outside
passenger to go inside or to remain inside without
the consent of one at least among those already
within; and when that permission was granted,
the outsider was to be placed next the consenting
passenger.</p>

<p>The height to which luggage might be piled
on the roof of a coach was also carefully set forth.
From March 1st, 1811, it became unlawful for
any driver, owner or proprietor to permit luggage,
or indeed any person, on the roof of a coach the
top of which was more than 8 ft. 9 in. from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
ground, or whose gauge was less than 4 ft. 6 in.
Coaches must then have been of an extraordinary
height to need such a clause as this. The penalty
for infringing it was £5. Luggage on ordinary
stage-coaches was not to exceed 2 ft. in height, or
three-horsed coaches, 18 in., with a penalty of
£5 for every inch in excess. Luggage might be
carried to a greater height if it was not, in all,
more than 10 ft 9 in. from the ground. Turnpike
keepers and others were given powers to have the
luggage measured, and passengers themselves
might see that it was done; and drivers refusing
such measurements to be taken were to be fined,
on conviction, 50<i>s.</i> Passengers, too, came in for
their share. No passenger was to sit on the
luggage, or the place reserved for it, under the
like penalty of 50<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Intoxicated coachmen came in for a maximum
£10 penalty, or the alternative of a term of
imprisonment not less than three months or not
exceeding six; insulting coachmen, or others
exacting more than the proper fare, or endangering
passengers’ lives, a maximum of 40<i>s.</i>, or
imprisonment of three days to one month.
Mail-coach drivers, being more responsible officials,
were awarded the heavier of the above
penalties for any among a variety of possible
offences—such as loitering, or hindering the
conduct of his Majesty’s mails to the next
stage, or wilfully misspending or losing time, so
that the mails did not travel at the rates of speed
specified by the Postmaster-General.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
Licences were to specify the number of persons
inside and out the coaches were authorised to
carry; and any running without a licence, or
carrying passengers in excess, were to be fined £10
for each passenger or additional passenger, or
double if the driver were also owner or part-owner.
If the offending coachman could be proved to have
carried the additional passengers without the
knowledge of the proprietors, and if the proprietors
derived no profit from it, they escaped the penalty,
which then had to be borne by the coachman, with
the alternative of imprisonment.</p>

<p>These regulations were notoriously broken with
impunity every day in the year. Passengers sat
on the luggage if they felt so inclined; coachmen
got drunk, drove furiously, or allowed the deadly
amateur to drive; luggage was stacked to alpine
heights; guards discharged their blunderbusses
everywhere from sheer wantonness or on joyful
occasions; passengers were carried to excess; and,
indeed, every provision of every Act was flagrantly
violated, generally of malice aforethought,
but not seldom from very ignorance and the sheer
inability of coach-proprietors and the others concerned
to keep themselves fully informed on all
points. The waggoners especially found it difficult,
with the best will in the world, to keep the
law; and even the pikemen at the turnpike gates,
who were the sworn enemies of all the users of the
roads, but who were bound to comply with certain
regulations, often heedlessly omitted the formulæ as
by law established, and became liable to penalties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
This lengthy and confusing series of Acts
brought into existence that contemptible parasite,
the Professional Informer. By those provisions,
which awarded sometimes the whole penalty, and
in other cases the half or two-thirds, or merely
one-third, at the discretion of the magistrates, to
those persons who would discover these infringements
of the law to the authorities, the Sneak
became an institution, wholly supported by the
involuntary contributions of the coaching world.
Informers swarmed on every road, and their
operations were conducted with a legal astuteness
and business acumen that would have made the
fortunes of these gentry if they had directed their
talents into more reputable channels. For although
Parliament had created the Informer, it is not to
be thought that he was liked by any class. He
was held to be a necessary evil, as from fear of
him offenders might be made to mend their ways,
and so the roads be preserved. The end, it was
thought, justified the means employed. No one
knew the Acts of Parliament through and through,
inside out and up and down, as this detested class.
Informers sometimes worked singly; at others
they constituted themselves into firms, with offices
and tame attorneys, and staffs of travelling spies,
whose travelling expenses were well repaid, with
a handsome profit besides, by the materials for
informations which they had obtained on the
roads. Indeed, it was stated that on certain routes
the waggoners paid annual sums to the informers,
as a kind of quit-rent against prosecutions; for,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
as an informer in a confidential moment was
heard to declare, the Acts were so many and so
conflicting that it was impossible to travel without
a breach of the law.</p>

<p>The greatest of all informers was Byers, who
combined the occupation with that of a small
shopkeeper in the outskirts of London. The acts
of Byers may be traced through many old files of
newspapers, and even <em>then</em> you shall not discover
his Christian name; for in those records it is
generally “Byers again!” or “Byers appeared
before So-and-so charging What’s-his-name.”
Thus do we speak of the great in war, in science,
in literature; for custom tells only of a Wellington,
a Newton, or a Thackeray. We know their
titles and Christian names, but suppress them to
gain a grand and monumental simplicity. To
reduce the argument to a logical conclusion,
Byers was a greater than these, for we do not even
know his baptismal cognomen. He is a classic
now, for Barham accorded him the honour of an
allusion and an explanatory note in one of the
<i>Ingoldsby Legends</i>—the “Lay of St. Nicholas,”
where we <span class="locked">read:—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Accusing Byers “flew up to Heaven’s Chancery,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blushing like scarlet with shame and concern.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">The note describes him as “The Prince of Peripatetic
Informers, and terror of Stage Coachmen,
when such things were. Alack! alack! the Railroads
have ruined his ‘vested interest.’” Time
has so dimmed the meaning of both the reference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
and the explanation that modern commentators
are generally puzzled by both. What he was we
have stated; what became of him when railways
ruined coaching and his business at once, we do
not know. Some few details of his career have
survived. He originally seems to have been in
the employ of one Johnson, an informer, in 1824,
when he obtained convictions against coachmen at
Dover and Canterbury, and on the Brighton Road;
but by the summer of the next year he had gone
into the business for himself, and presently became
the Napoleon of the profession. 1825 was a busy
year with him. In August he summoned a coach-proprietor
named Selby for that “on the 28th day
of July he did suffer and permit a stage-coach
belonging to him, and drawn by two horses only,
to carry more than the usual number of passengers
on the roof.” Moreover, he was summoned
again for not having his name painted on
the door of the coach. After much cross-swearing
and discussion, the Brighton bench fined the
coach-proprietor £5 and 16<i>s.</i> costs.</p>

<p>In Bath, in the November of the same year,
Byers laid so many as thirty-four informations.
The penalties to which the unfortunate coach-proprietors
and others were liable in this prodigious
batch were estimated at £500, but the
newspaper reports of that time do not tell us the
total of the fines actually inflicted, so we are
unable to form any idea of the profits realised by
the enterprising Byers in this Western raid. The
petty and tyrannical nature of the prosecutions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
may be gathered from one instance before the
Bathforum (for such was the style and title
of the local bench) magistrates. A farmer was
summoned for not having his Christian name and
surname painted on the <em>right</em> or off-side of his
waggon, and mulcted in 10<i>s.</i> and costs, while
another for the same mistake in the position was
fined 5<i>s.</i> and costs; the magistrates, in addition,
holding that the strict letter of the law required
not only the name of the owner and that of the
town, but the street as well.</p>

<p>A great sheaf of informations was laid by him
at Brighton in July 1827. William Blunden,
proprietor of a stage-van, was summoned—not for
carrying more passengers than he should, but for
not having painted on his conveyance the number
of passengers his licence entitled him to carry.
A £5 fine was the result, of which Byers was
awarded 50<i>s.</i> and costs. In another of his cases
on this occasion the informer did not come off
victorious. It was not his master-mind that had
prepared the cases, but that of one of his hirelings,
Aaron Rolland, and there was a fatal flaw in this
particular one. It was a summons against Snow,
the Brighton proprietor, for carrying passengers
in excess; but, unfortunately for the prosecution,
the coach was not plying for hire on that occasion,
and Byers suffered defeat.</p>

<p>In this same year Byers was arrested and
imprisoned for debt, but he was soon out again
and prosecuting with redoubled energy. In
November William Cripps, of the firm of Cripps &amp;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
Wilkins, coach-proprietors, appeared at his instance
before the Brighton magistrates, charged
with permitting a name other than that of the
licensees to be painted on his coach. The name
was that of the afterwards celebrated Henry
Stevenson, of the “Age.” It was placed there with
an idea of securing patronage for the coach, and
it was contended in court, that forty names might
so be painted on the panel of the coach, if the
proprietors liked. But the bench held otherwise,
and imposed two mitigated penalties of 50<i>s.</i> each
with costs, it being the first offence.</p>

<p>In August 1830, Byers procured three fines of
£10 each and costs in an overloading case against
Francis Vickers. In this affair the methods of
himself and his spies were disclosed, for it
appeared that the spy was watching the coaches
from the upstairs window of a public-house. But
already, for some time past, one of Byers’ men
had set up for himself as a coachman’s lawyer,
and, coming from the opposition camp, of course
brought with him a great deal of special knowledge.
From this time Byers’ business waned.
The early steam-carriages of 1826 had foreshadowed
the end of the coaching age, and when railways
came the informers’ business was ruined. True,
they might still make a trifle out of the surviving
waggons, and it was possible, now and again, to
catch a pikeman not giving a ticket when toll was
paid, or not having his own name painted on his
toll-board as collector when he had succeeded
some other pikeman; but the penalties for these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
offences were, like the offences themselves, trivial.
In short, informing ceased to pay its travelling
expenses.</p>

<p>Among the many enactments for the protection
of the public was one forbidding all four horses
galloping at the same time. Mail-contractors,
however, finding that they could not maintain
the speed necessary to fulfil their contracts
without galloping, generally secured a certain
number of exceptionally fast trotters, for which
they paid high prices, in order to have one in
every team. Such an one was pretty widely
known down the road as “the Parliamentary
horse.” Proprietors of fast day-coaches, however,
infringed this provision of the Act every day, as
indeed every Act was continually infringed.</p>

<p>The last years of coaching were marked by a
reduction in the duties on stage-carriages, long
urged by the coaching interest, and introduced
by the Act of August 24th, 1839. It was a
grudging reduction, and came too late to be of
much relief to an oppressed industry. Up to
that date the mileage duty on passengers was
on the graduated scale of 1<i>d.</i> a mile if licensed
to carry four; 1½<i>d.</i> if licensed for six; 2<i>d.</i>
for nine; 2½<i>d.</i> for twelve; 3<i>d.</i> for fifteen; and
3½<i>d.</i> for eighteen; whether running fully loaded
or not. It was always open for proprietors to
license for more or less, according to the season
or their own requirements; but, on the other hand,
if in view of a slack season they licensed for a
small number and then on one of their journeys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
took up additional passengers, they were liable,
on conviction, to a heavy penalty. In addition,
there was a duty of 1<i>d.</i> a mile on the coach itself.
The concession of 1839 reduced this impost to
a halfpenny a mile, and provided a graduated
passenger duty by which a coach licensed for not
more than six persons paid 1<i>d.</i> a mile; up to
ten, 1½<i>d.</i>; not more than thirteen, 2<i>d.</i>; not more
than sixteen, 2½<i>d.</i>, and so on to the impossible
number of twenty-two, when the license would
be 3½<i>d.</i></p>

<p>According to a return made for 1838, the
mileage duty paid on stage-coaches in England
for that year was £166,625, showing a total
mileage for those twelve months of 40,530,000.
The Government thus apparently sacrificed
£83,312 10<i>s.</i> in reducing the mileage duty by
one-half; but the greatness of the sacrifice was
more apparent than real, for already railways
had begun and coaches were being discontinued
on every hand, while a small railway passenger
duty of one-eighth of a penny a mile made up
for its smallness by the increase in travelling that
railways brought.</p>

<p>Still later, the passenger duty on coaches was
further reduced, and made 1½<i>d.</i> a mile on any
number of passengers; while the annual stage-carriage
license was reduced from £5 to £3 3<i>s.</i>,
and the licence for each coachman or guard from
£1 5<i>s.</i> to 5<i>s.</i></p>

<p>The harassed coach-proprietors, or those who
still existed, were properly grateful for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
reduction made, for it just turned the scale in
many coaching accounts, and so kept on those
public conveyances where otherwise they would
have been commercially impossible. The railway
magnates, who had by that time become a power
in the land, could afford to influence the Government
in favour of these concessions, for the coaches
had already been driven off the direct routes, and
were no longer formidable competitors of the locomotive.
They had, indeed, become merely feeders
to the victorious railways.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE EARLY COACHMEN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">When</span> stage-coachmen are mentioned, the mind at
once flies to Mr. Tony Weller, a stout man with a
red face and a hoarse voice proceeding from the
depths of capacious shawls in which his throat is
muffled. Such was the typical coachman at any
time between the introduction of coaches and 1820,
when a leaven of smartness and gentility began to
be noticeable, and the time-honoured type to fade
away.</p>

<p>Coachmen were generally fat for the same
reason that postboys were thin: it was a necessity
of their occupation. The postboys bumped their
flesh away on horseback, but the coachman’s
sedentary occupation, and still more a tremendous
capacity for drinking induced by the open-air life,
caused him to accumulate fat to an immoderate
degree. The typical coachman is pictured in
Hood’s ballad of John Day, who was</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">the biggest man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the coachman kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With back too broad to be conceived<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By any narrow mind.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">But while it would probably be safe to declare,
without fear of contradiction, that there never was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
such a thing as a fat postboy, it would be the very
height of rashness to say that a lean coachman
was unknown. There were many such, but the
traditional coachman was a bulky person, helped
up to his seat by the combined efforts of the stable-helpers;
and Dickens, in picturing Tony Weller,
fell in with the public humour, although already
the type was become somewhat out of date.</p>

<p>The stage and mail coachmen were no exotics,
but, like every one else, the product of their
country and their times; and as those times
changed, so did they. The evolution of the smart
coachmen of the ’thirties can be followed, step
by step, until progress, in the shape of railways,
extinguished the species. The original floggers of
six horses, who could only get along by dint of
severely punishing those unhappy animals throughout
the day, were not really coachmen in the later
sense. They understood little of the art of coaching,
and were merely drivers. From early morn
to sundown they lashed the same horses along
the rutted ways, with intervals for mending the
harness—generally, according to the testimony of
the time, the “rotten harness”; but those would
have been wonderfully strong traces that could
long have withstood the strain they were subjected
to, and so they were probably not always so decayed
as contemporary accounts would have us believe.
Under these circumstances, and the generally hard
and rough life they led, it is not to be wondered at
that coachmen were originally a rough and brutal
class of men. They cannot be paralleled nowadays,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
and the difference between them and the later
ornaments of the box can only be understood
by comparing a modern van-driver with the
coachman of an aristocratic carriage—and then we
should be doing injustice to the van-man.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>“MY DEAR, YOU’RE A PLUMPER”; COACHMAN AND BARMAID.<br />
<span class="fright"><i>After Rowlandson.</i></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>As coaching progressed and twenty-mile stages
replaced the day-long toil of the horses, not only
did the six-horse give place to four-horse teams,
but coachmen improved. There was need for such
improvement, and all the science and resource of
which they were capable were put to the proof.
Mud, stones, ruts, sandy places to plough through,
steep hills to lash his horses up to, and dangerous
descents to hold them in, were the commonplaces
of the coachman’s career up to the dawning of the
nineteenth century. The coaches, too, were heavy
and clumsy, and harness now really was rotten,
and had every now and again to be mended while
the passengers waited with what patience they
could command. Happily, time was not “of the
essence of the contract,” as the lawyers say, and
half a day late was no matter at that period. But
all these difficulties made the coachman of those
times an expert in many things. He was not of
that later kind, finicking in manner and dandies
upon the box, but a great, weather-beaten, bluff
and gruff creature, mummified in wraps; an expert
in getting the last ounce out of his cattle, and
ready with his whip, not always because he was
brutal by nature, but because he had to thrash the
wretched animals to get his coach along at all.
The coachmen of those days wore their whips out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
frequently, and a usual detail of their equipment
was the dozen or more of whipcord points in the
button-hole, ready to be spliced on—an operation
they could perform with ease and efficiency with
their teeth while driving. When even the double-thonged
whip failed to rouse the poor brutes to
super-equine exertions, the “apprentice”—a kind
of cat o’ nine tails—was brought into use, and the
wheelers thrashed with it. This engine of torture
was in later years known familiarly as the “short
Tommy,” and was kept in reserve on many provincial
coaches. Among those familiar with coaching in
its last years, some have asserted the use of this
instrument up to the time when coaches themselves
disappeared, and others deny it. Both were right
and both wrong: on some roads it was on occasion
brought forth, while on others it was unknown.</p>

<p>There were no smart coachmen before the introduction
of mail-coaches. Before coaches carried
the mails and the drivers became, in a sense,
officials and persons of importance, wreathed
around with a vague atmosphere of authority,
your average driver took no sort of pride in himself.
Nor, supposing the existence of one who
fared the roads in smart attire, could he for long
have kept so gay and debonair an appearance.
The meagreness and uncertainty of his livelihood
forbade it, and if those factors had been eliminated,
there still remained the unutterable badness of the
roads to discourage him, together with the longer
spells of driving that these earlier men knew,
which wearied them and rendered them careless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
of details. Thus the stage-drivers of the era that
preceded the classic age of the road wore clumsy
hay-bands round their legs to protect them from
the cold, and, together with their many layers of
clothing, their top-boots encrusted with the mud
of a month’s journeys, and their general air of
untidiness, were figures of fun, in sharp contrast
with their brethren of a later day, who were certain
of their employment, of their liberal and frequent
tips, of good roads exceedingly well kept, and of
their coaches and cattle being maintained in the
pink of condition by a small army of stable-hands
and helpers. The poor old fellows of a bygone
age wore perhaps nothing but fold upon fold of
“comforters” round their necks, while their linen
did not bear inspection. The flower of the coaching
age, on the other hand—the coachmen of the first
quarter of the nineteenth century—wore the gayest
and the neatest neckties as a finish to a neat and
striking professional costume. They were artists
alike in the management of their horses and in the
folding of a tie. Never a journey but they had
a posy in their buttonhole, and never an occasion
when they were not spotlessly clean, in linen,
top-boots, and costume generally. It was an
unmistakable costume, and one familiar to us nowadays
in its revival by modern coaching enthusiasts.
Box-cloth coats, fearfully and wonderfully stitched
in five or six rows, and decorated with buttons of
an enormous size, together with white beaver hats,
were the most outstanding items of this marvellous
costume.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
A reminiscent traveller, writing in 1831, lets
some light into dark places. He said he was old
enough to remember a certain West-country coach,
which he took to be representative of others at
that period. It always took ten, and sometimes
twelve hours to do fifty-seven miles. “Now,” he
said, marvelling at the progress of the age, “it
takes only six hours.” Joe Emmens, the driver
of this slow coach, was famous for never at
any time turning away a would-be passenger, no
matter how crowded his conveyance, which was
often observed to be carrying seventeen out and
nine in, with parcels and hampers tied to and
suspended from all kinds of hazardous places.
This did not, we sorrowfully acknowledge, argue
zeal for his employers’ interests, but only an
inordinate appetite for those “short fares” which
by ancient use and wont the coachman pocketed.
The custom was as old as that of “tipping.”</p>

<p>Tipping the coachman, a practice already mentioned,
was early introduced. It originated, there
can scarce be any reasonable doubt, with the very
first stage-coach journey, and flourished exceedingly
to the very last, when the guard as well came in
for his share. The custom was originally known
as “capping,” from the coachman coming with
hat or cap in hand for these contributions: a
humble and beggarly method to which the later
artists of the coachbox were wholly strangers.
The later generation, it is true, removed their hats
as a matter of courtesy when they “left you here,”
but their fee was no longer chucked negligently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
into that headgear, as of old, but discreetly inserted
into an extended palm, and received as
of right.</p>

<p>The earliest stages of tipping showed the practice
in a very logical and commonsense light, for
although the later coachmen could be very surly
and disobliging if they were not “remembered,”
they had not a tithe of those opportunities of being
actively offensive which the older race of drivers
enjoyed. The later generations of coachmen were
more directly responsible. They worked to a time-table,
on good roads, with fine cattle and perfect
coaches; the older men stopped when and where
they liked, and altogether had the comfort or discomfort
of their passengers very largely in their
hands. Thus they were to be conciliated and kept
in good humour by a reasonable expectancy of
vails. We first hear of tipping in 1665, in <i>The
Committee</i>, Sir Robert Howard’s comedy, where
the vulgar committeeman’s wife gives Toby, the
coachman, something less than he expected. “By
my whip,” he says aside, “’tis a groat of more
than ordinary thinness. Plague on this new
gentry,” he adds, with a sneer, “how liberal
they are!”</p>

<p>“Tipping” grew and flourished extravagantly
in after ages. The wealthy and the free-handed
set the standard then, as they do now in these
otherwise altered times, with the result that
those who could not afford the outlay in which
the richer indulged were generally insulted or
neglected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
It was not often that the coachmen were so
outspoken as the hero of the following tale.
“What do you expect?” asked a passenger new
to the road of him when collecting the customary
tips at the end of his stage. That ornament of
the box was blunt and frank: “Gents generally
gives me a shilling; fools with more money than
brains gives me half a crown,” he said. What, in
that case, could the passenger do but proclaim
himself, in the amount of his gratuity, a “gent”

the coachman-philosopher was a loser to the extent
of one-and-sixpence?</p>

<span class="subhead">THE LATER COACHMEN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">The</span> smart coachmen came into existence with
short stages and the fast day-coaches, about 1824.
They did not burst suddenly upon an astonished
world—were not, like those insect-wonders,
chrysalids in the morning and butterflies in the
afternoon—but developed by insensible degrees.
The first incentive to this improvement was,
doubtless, that acquaintance with the moneyed
sporting world which began when the country
gentlemen ceased to travel horseback and took
to going by coach, and thence, from passive
passengers, developed an interest in driving;
sitting beside the coachman and learning from
him something of what those worthies now, for
the first time in their lives, began dimly to perceive
was an art, and not merely an ordinary wage-earning
occupation. When Jack Bailey, of the
old “Prince of Wales,” who taught old John
Warde, the first of the amateurs, how to drive,
tutored him, he wrought a greater revolution than
he knew. Acquaintance with, and tutorship of,
the growing ranks of the amateurs brought a
strange alteration in themselves. They taught
the young sprigs of nobility coaching, and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
pupils unconsciously initiated them in new
manners of thought, speech and dress. The two
classes strangely reacted on one another, for
while the coachmen learned to discard top-boots
and took to trousers, the amateurs thought it
a fine thing to file their front teeth, so that they
could splice whip-points and spit like the professionals,
to wear the heavy “double Benjamins,”
clumsy and many-caped, that were necessary for
the coachmen, and to be, in fact, as thoroughly
“down the road” in dress, manner and talk as
though they were professionals themselves. Each
exaggerated the most remarkable features of the
other, so that the coachmen became caricature
gentlemen, and the gentlemen the most wonderful
travesties of the coachmen.</p>

<p>An admiring critic of coaching in its last
decade enlarged with great satisfaction upon
the complete dissimilarity between the modern
“artists” and the “workmen” of old time.
Their change of character and appearance had
kept pace with the improvements in the different
points of their profession. No longer did one see
the dram-drinking, gin-consuming, jolly-looking
rotundities of yore. Instead of those honest, wet
old souls, the “ribbons” were handled by pinks
of perfection, turned out at all points like gentlemen,
and in character also like gentlemen, tasting
nothing but their glass of sherry from end to end
of a journey.</p>

<span class="fright"><i>After H. Alken.</i></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>But side by side with these improvements
upon the old order came what were known to our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
grandfathers as the “flash men,” who, at the
extremity of ill-assumed gentility, were probably
more objectionable than the rough-and-ready old
fellows of an earlier generation. The flash coachman
flourished very rankly indeed at Birmingham,
Manchester, Glasgow, Liverpool, Leeds, and other
great commercial centres. He always dressed
in the extreme of fashion, and perhaps a little in
advance of it. His silken stock was swathed
higher up his neck, his gold (or gilded) scarf-pin
was bigger, his waistcoat had a more alarming
pattern, his hat was more curly in the brim than
others, and in his conversation and manners he
dotted the “i’s” and crossed the “t’s” of his
betters. He was, in fact, an unconscious caricature
of those among the upper classes who took
an interest in the road, and was a very loud,
insufferable and offensive person, who, it was said,
“had a missus at both ends,” smoked a dozen real
Havanahs in a hundred miles, and hardly thanked
you for half a crown. Such men imposed upon
many of the good commercial folks of those
trading towns who were foolish enough and
inexperienced enough to take cigar-smoking for
superiority and overdressed insolence for the hallmark
of gentility; and these fellows became, in
consequence, the curse of the roads. Borrow has,
in his <i>Romany Rye</i>, a very vigorous chapter on
their kind, but errs in so far as he seems to
consider that they, and they only, formed the
“stage-coachmen of England.”</p>

<p>“The stage-coachmen of England, at the time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
of which I am speaking, considered themselves
mighty fine gentry; nay, I verily believe, the
most important personages of the realm, and their
entertaining this high opinion of themselves can
hardly be wondered at: they were low fellows,
but masters at driving; driving was in fashion,
and sprigs of nobility used to dress as coachmen,
and imitate the slang and behaviour of the coachmen,
from whom occasionally they would take
lessons in driving, as they sat beside them on the
box, which post of honour any sprig of nobility
who happened to take a place on a coach claimed
as his unquestionable right; and these sprigs
would smoke cigars and drink sherry with the
coachmen in bar-rooms and on the road; and when
bidding them farewell would give them a guinea or
a half-guinea, and shake them by the hand, so that
these fellows, being low fellows, very naturally
thought no small liquor of themselves, but would
talk familiarly of their friends Lords So-and-so, the
Honourable Misters So-and-so, and Sir Harry and
Sir Charles, and be wonderfully saucy to any one
who was not a lord or something of the kind;
and this high opinion of themselves received daily
augmentation from the servile homage paid them
by the generality of the untitled male passengers,
especially those on the forepart of the coach, who
used to contend for the honour of sitting on the
box with the coachman when no sprig was nigh to
put in his claim. Oh! what servile homage these
craven creatures did pay these same coach fellows,
more especially this or t’other act of brutality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
practised upon the weak and unoffending—upon
some poor friendless woman travelling with but
little money, and perhaps a brace of hungry
children with her, or upon some thin and half-starved
man travelling on the hind part of the
coach from London to Liverpool, with only
eighteen-pence in his pocket to defray his expenses
on the road; for as the insolence of these
knights was vast, so was their rapacity enormous;
they had been so long accustomed to have crowns
and half-crowns rained upon them by their
admirers and flatterers that they would look at a
shilling, for which many an honest labourer was
happy to toil for ten hours under a broiling sun,
with the utmost contempt; would blow upon it
derisively, or fillip it into the air before they
pocketed it; but when nothing was given them,
as would occasionally happen—for how could they
receive from those who had nothing? and nobody
was bound to give them anything, as they had
certain wages from their employers—then what
a scene would ensue! Truly, the brutality and
rapacious insolence of English coachmen had
reached a climax; it was time that these fellows
should be disenchanted, and the time—thank
Heaven!—was not far distant. Let the craven
dastards who used to curry favour with them, and
applaud their brutality, lament their loss now that
they and their vehicles have disappeared from the
roads.”</p>

<p>Here the Borrovian fury overreaches itself, and
fails to convince the reader of that brutality of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
a whole class he would fain have you believe in.
Were the later coachmen, indeed, moulded in so
unvarying a form? Assuredly not, for character
still survived in the individual before the railway
age dawned, and nowhere was more marked than
on the box-seat. The sole person convicted of
brutality in that attack is Borrow himself, consigning
all the objects of his dislike to misery and
want.</p>

<p>Such men might have been found; but we have
only to mention old Thomas Cross, the dreamy,
poetical, shiftless, other-worldly coachman of the
“Lynn Union,” the Wards, and John Thorogood,
on the Norwich Road, to see that the road was not
handed over entirely to ruffians of the kind Borrow
draws. But in all coachmen reigned an autocratic
spirit, born of their mastery over four horses. In
some this was expressed by contemptuous replies
when passengers unqualified for the task endeavoured
to talk about coaching and horsey
matters; in others it was manifested by a faraway
and unapproachable meditation or contemplation—or
perhaps even vacuity of mind—like
that of some Indian fakir dwelling upon the
perfections of Buddha; beside which many a
box-seat passenger felt a mere worm.</p>

<p>It was difficult to penetrate this professional
reserve. A remarkable character of this type was
John Wilson, who drove the “Everlasting” coach
between Wolverhampton and Worcester; a coach
so called because, at a time when all the direct
routes were being abandoned to railways, this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
cross-country journey was left open and unchallenged
for many years. John, in addition to
being a coachman, was host of the “King’s Head,”
a minor house in Bell Street, Wolverhampton, but
was a taciturn and grumpy individual. He drove
only at the jog-trot of eight miles an hour, and
so had no excuse on that score for silence. He
cherished the greatest dislike to being questioned,
and his replies, especially to strangers, were of
the briefest and surliest. On the occasion of the
British Association visiting Dudley in 1849, a
gentleman residing at Worcester, being very
anxious to attend the meetings of so learned a
body, secured a box-seat on the “Everlasting” to
Dudley. John was the coachman on that occasion.
The historian of it is the passenger <span class="locked">himself:—</span></p>

<p>“‘A nice mild day, coachman,’ I said, as he
mounted and took the ribbons.</p>

<p>“‘’Tis, sir.’</p>

<p>“(After a pause of five minutes.) ‘What time
do you get to Dudley?’</p>

<p>“‘Eight o’clock.’</p>

<p>“(A quarter of an hour’s pause.) ‘Capital crop
of turnips this year, coachman.’</p>

<p>“‘Ees.’</p>

<p>“(A pause of twenty minutes, varied only by
some long yawns from the coachman, and some
responsive ones from myself.)</p>

<p>“‘I say, driver, can you tell me who’s dead at
that house?’</p>

<p>“‘Don’t know. ‘Niver inquires about nothing—yaw—haw—a-haw,’
yawning prodigiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
“Here a passenger pointed out to ‘coachey’
a covey of partridges in an adjoining field, and
asked him if he knew the price of birds at
Worcester.</p>

<p>“‘No,’ says he, ‘I don’t—yaw-he-haw; but
fresh herrings at Wolverhampton be mighty cheap
at thirty a shilling.’</p>

<p>“Another quarter of an hour’s profound silence,
and we arrived at the ‘Crown,’ Ombersley.
Seeing the fate that awaited me, of being linked
to this dreary fellow for a journey of nearly thirty
miles, I proposed to him a gentle stimulant, and
expressed my apprehension that he was considerably
out of condition.</p>

<p>“‘Well, then, I’ll ha’ some brandy, I s’pose,’
he replied, with as much politeness and satisfaction
at this sixpenny treat as a porker may be supposed
to entertain on his first introduction to a bucket
of grains. Too soon, however, I found this investment
of my capital was more than useless—the
man with the whip would not be drawn out. His
horses, too, seemed to be under the influence of the
same stupifying medium, jogging along at a rate
which rendered our arrival at Dudley a probability
somewhat remote.”</p>

<p>John, oddly enough, was succeeded by another
Wilson, but not a relative. William Wilson was
the direct antithesis to his predecessor, and when
the “Everlasting,” belying its proud name, went
off the road before the advance of the Great
Western Railway from Oxford to Worcester, he
left pleasing memories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
Jo Walton, on the Cambridge Road, was a
notable whip of the smarter kind. No unwieldy
stout man he, but tall and slim, faultlessly dressed,
and one of the best coachmen that ever drove.
The railway spoiled him in mid-career, but not
before the very knowing gentlemen who wrote for
the sporting periodicals of the age had made his
a classic figure. The Cambridge Road alone was
Walton’s ground. He drove the “Safety,” and
then the “Times,” in six hours; but it was not
until he succeeded to the box-seat of the “Star of
Cambridge” that he came into notice. That coach
performed the fifty-two miles between the “Belle
Sauvage” and the “Hoop” at Cambridge in five
hours. With fifteen minutes deducted for breakfast
on the way, and another fifteen for changing,
this gives four hours and a half actual running, or
a speed of nearly eleven and three-quarter miles
an hour: an incredible rate of progress, but
vouched for by a contributor to the <i>New Sporting
Magazine</i> in 1833.</p>

<p>Jo Walton drove the “Star” double, every
day except Sunday, leaving the “Hoop,” at Cambridge
at 7 a.m., reaching London at noon, and
setting forth again for Cambridge the same afternoon.
This feat of driving over a hundred miles
a day he continued until the railway by degrees
caused the splendour of the “Star” to wane.</p>

<p>The Cambridge Road has, of course, many dead
level stretches, and Walton was sometimes known
to put the coach along a certain five miles in
twenty minutes. Yet, according to the enthusiastic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
chronicler of these things, he was among the
safest of coachmen—a testimony not supported by
the fact that he twice upset the “Star” between
Royston and Buntingford. His determination to
keep his time was, we are told, superior to all
mercenary considerations or regard for the “short
pocket.” Thus, although he pulled up on one
occasion when hailed on the road by a gentleman
in a phaeton, saying he “might as well have this
half-crown as not,” he drove off again because the
passenger did not come instantly.</p>

<p>He was, according to the admiring testimony
of the time, a fixture on the box—nothing could
throw him off. A scientific punisher of refractory
horses, too; accompanying the corrective discipline
of the whip with much grim humour. Passing
through Buntingford one day, the chestnut near
leader attempted to bolt into a public-house. “I
didn’t know your friends lived <em>there</em>,” said Walton.
“Come, come, now you are got into this coach you
must give up low company,” and two slashing
strokes of the whip followed. Walton, it was said,
had the temper of an emperor and a tongue as
fluent and free as that of a bargee. The story was
told that he refused to pull up for a passenger
who had lost his hat, and that the passenger thereupon
pushed Walton’s off, compelling him to halt;
but that tale was either untrue or the passenger
unacquainted with Walton. It was not likely that
any one who knew him would have taken such a
liberty. We are not told what became of that
impulsive passenger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
The characteristics of coachmen had every
opportunity of being well impressed upon box-seat
passengers down the long monotonous miles, and
their peculiarities have accordingly been well
preserved in travellers’ recollections. One choice
spirit, who drove the Leeds “Union” from the
“George and Blue Boar” in Holborn to Eaton
Socon, let his leaders down in Biggleswade street,
so that they broke their knees. He observed that
they had made a terrible “fore paw,” but whether
that was conscious or unconscious humour remains
uncertain.</p>

<p>A sharp distinction was drawn between London
and provincial coachmen, and between coachmen
on main roads and those on by-ways. Yorkshire
by-roads, in particular, were regarded by coaching
critics, from Nimrod downwards, with contempt,
alike for their coaches and coachmen. Thus, one
tells in 1830 of a dirty coach in Yorkshire, drawn
by a team of “tike” horses known to the coachman
by the names of Rumbleguts and Bumblekite,
Staggering Bob and Davey. On the cross-roads
of that many-acred shire the coachmen changed
with every stage, and cleaned and harnessed their
own horses. They were, in fact, in those remote
parts, a hundred years behind the age, and one
might in the nineteenth century have studied the
manners and customs of the early eighteenth. The
same thing was noticed by Hawker in 1812, on the
Glasgow and Carlisle road, where the stage-coachmen
resembled “a set of dirty gipsies,” driving but
one stage each, and then looking after their horses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
Those country hands were not in general very
great respecters of rank or station. The London
coachmen were civil, had a peculiar humour about
them, and did not consider themselves <em>quite</em> the
equal of the box-seat passenger who sat beside
them; but the provincial performer poked one in
the ribs when he wanted to say anything, and
perhaps nearly ejected one from the box by his
“knowing” jerk of the elbow when he considered
emphasis necessary to point his remarks. The old
six-inside coaches survived here long after they
had been forgotten in most other parts of the
country, often driven by a coachman as comfortable
as a “drop” of gin could make him, and
drawn by horses as weak as the water he forgot to
put into his last tumbler. In such an ominous
combination, the passengers involuntarily repeated
the prayer in the Litany for “all travellers by land.”</p>

<p>Drunken coachmen are heard of in the old
coaching annals, and accidents caused by them
when in that state stand on record, but they are
comparatively few. It was not so easy a matter
to make a seasoned coachman—even one of only
a few years’ experience—drunk. The capacity of
coachmen for drink was marvellous. As throwing
some light upon it, a meeting with Harry Ward
at the “White Hart,” Andover, may be instanced.
He was then on the famous “Quicksilver” Devonport
Mail.</p>

<p>On this occasion it was a cold winter’s night,
and Ward was waiting for the “Quicksilver” to
come up, and to take his stage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
“How many brandys-and-water does that make
to-day?” asked a passenger who had just stood
him one, hot.</p>

<p>“This is the twentieth,” replied Ward. (A
glass of brandy-and-water then cost 1<i>s.</i>)</p>

<p>He was not regarded by his contemporaries as
an intemperate man, and was never known to be
the worse for drink; but he felt called upon to
explain those twenty glasses, and said, “You soon
get it blown out of you, crossing Salisbury Plain.”</p>

<p>This was in 1837, and Ward was then only
twenty-four years of age. “Youthful depravity,”
some might say, and surmise an early and unhappy
end. But facts controvert such views. Harry
Ward, who had already, in 1833, driven on the
London and Glasgow Mail, and was then the
youngest coachman on the road, was also among
the steadiest, and owed his transference to the
Devonport “Quicksilver” to that already established
reputation. To his last days—he died in
1894, in his 81st year—he was proud of the fact
that he never had an accident on any road.</p>

<p>Coachmen seem never to have been averse from
loading their coaches to their fullest capacity,
except in one particular. Barrels of oysters, kegs
of spirits, hampers of game, and such heavy and
bulky things, seem never to have roused objections;
but they nursed a grudge against literature,
for when the quarterly reviews were published
and magazine-time came round, and the fore and
hind boots of the night coaches were crammed
with the damp sheets just issued from the press,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
they discovered that the weight severely tried
weak teams over long stages, <i>Edinburgh</i> and
<i>Quarterly</i> reviewers prided themselves on their
literary weight, which was an unknown quantity
to the coachmen, who cursed them for their
avoirdupois.</p>

<p>These old Automedons rarely took a holiday,
and when they did were at a loss how to use it.
Like London omnibus drivers of the present time
under similar circumstances, they generally spent
their off-time in riding on some other coach and
criticising the driving. The postboys were alike
in this respect. One of the fraternity—Tom King,
of the “Crown,” at Amersham, spent his holiday in
a most peculiar manner. He had had the honour,
on one occasion, of driving “Farmer George”
post, after hunting with the Royal Staghounds,
from Amersham to Windsor; and to the end of
his life he would do no work on the anniversary of
that day. After breakfast he repaired to the same
yellow post-chaise, and sat in it till nightfall, on
the seat his Sovereign had occupied. Throughout
the day he refreshed himself liberally with pots of
ale, and if he took his pipe from his lips at intervals,
it was only to replace it with a key-bugle
and to play “God save the King.” His master
humoured his fancy, and visited the post-chaise
with many others during the day, to see Tom
indulging in these quaint Pleasures of Memory.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI" class="vspace">CHAPTER XI<br />

<span class="subhead">MAIL-GUARDS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">When</span> Palmer first introduced his plan of mail-coaches
he proposed that, while the contractors
supplied coaches and horses and the men to drive
them, the guards should be the servants of the
Post Office, and should, considering the dangers of
the roads, be retired soldiers, who, from their past
training and habits of discipline, would be reliable
servants and men capable of defending the mails
against attack. This advice was not followed,
and the first mail-guards were provided by the
contractors, who employed such unsatisfactory
men that in a very short time the Post Office was
obliged to make the position of a mail-guard a
Post Office appointment and the guards themselves
servants of and directly responsible to the
Department.</p>

<p>Placed on this footing, they were by no means
fellow-servants with the coachmen, but their
official superiors, and not properly concerned in
any way with the passengers or any unofficial
parcels or luggage. In practice, however, they
took part in all these things, and although the
coachmen were technically under their orders, it
was only when ill-assorted and quarrelsome men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
came together on one coach that any disputes
arose.</p>

<p>Mail-coaches had not long been established
before the guards, those protectors of his Majesty’s
mails, presuming upon their position, became the
tyrants of the road. Pennant, writing in 1792,
tells how, in his district of Wales, “the guards,
relying on the name of royalty, in the course of
the Irish road through North Wales, committed
great excesses. One, on a trifling quarrel, shot
dead a poor old gatekeeper.... In Anglesey
another of these guards discharged his pistol
wantonly in the face of a chaise-horse, drawing his
master, the Rev. John Bulkeley, who was flung
out and died, either on the spot or soon after.
These guards shoot at dogs, hogs, sheep, and
poultry as they pass the road, and even in towns,
to the great terror and danger of the inhabitants.”
As with the mail-guards, so with the mail-coachmen.
“It has been a common practice with them
to divert themselves with flinging out their lashes
at harmless passengers, by way of fun. Very
lately, one of these wretches succeeded so well as
to twist his lash round a poor fellow’s neck in the
parish where I live. He dragged the man under
the wheels, by which one of his arms was broken.”</p>

<p>Not only Pennant complained of the early
mail-guards. The country in general went in
terror of them and their lethal weapons, the bell-mouthed
blunderbusses which they carried to
protect the mails and were wont to discharge at
random as they went along. It was, with some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
pardonable exaggeration, said that the Post Office
had conferred a licence for indiscriminate slaughter
upon them; for not only were they armed against
attack, but during the wars with France (and we
were always fighting the French in those days)
the Postmaster-General issued a kind of commission
to mail-guards to shoot any prisoner of war breaking
parole. To promote zeal in this direction, a
reward of £5 was offered for every prisoner so
winged or killed. Prisoners of war were plentiful
then, and in Edinburgh Castle, on Dartmoor, and
at “Yaxley Barracks,” near Norman Cross, on the
Great North Road, were to be counted in thousands.
At Yaxley, as also perhaps at other places, they
were often allowed out on parole, with the understanding
that they were not to leave the high road
and were not to remain out after sunset. It is not
on record that any prisoner was thus shot, but
many inoffensive rustics were wounded by guards
sportively inclined, or—with what St. Paul calls
a “zeal not according to discretion”—eager to
earn the reward offered.</p>

<p>The mail-guards were, indeed, very dangerous
fellows to the law-abiding subjects of the King,
however innocuous they may have been to
the law-breakers. We may dismiss the cutlass
with which they were armed. Not much
damage could be accidentally wrought by that;
but the blunderbuss was a terror to nervous
passengers by the mail, for when the guard
sportively loosed it off at the wayside sparrows,
or at the ploughman busy against the sky-line, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
exploded with the roar of a cannon, and some of
its slugs generally whistled unpleasantly past the
ears of the outsides or pierced their tall beaver
hats. The guard, in fact, was a person to be
shunned when he took his blunderbuss in hand,
either for practice or examination; for it was not
only dangerous as a gun, but was furnished with
a bayonet which, folding back on a hinge against
the barrel, was released by touching a powerful
spring. How many persons were accidentally
slain or mutilated by the guards’ awkward handling
of this infernal contrivance we shall never
know.</p>

<p>It was not, however, until 1811 that anything
was done to stop this indiscriminate shooting on
the part of the guards; but in that year an Act of
Parliament came into existence which forbade the
firing of their blunderbusses except for defence,
and instituting a penalty of £5 for breaking this
new law.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the position of mail-guard had
become a dignified and desirable one, often obtained
through Parliamentary and other influence brought

<p>It was not the salary that made the position of
a mail-guard so well worth having. He received
only 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week from the Department, and
his uniform of trousers, top-boots, scarlet coat,
frogged across the front of the body with gold lace,
and a gold-banded black tall hat with a cockade.
Out of his miserable half-guinea he had to himself
provide the cost of oil for the hand-lamp in front
of his seat on the dickey, and to pay the stable-helpers
who cleaned his tools and tool-box, oiled
and reloaded every day his blunderbuss and pair
of pistols, and performed a variety of odd jobs that
took live shillings a week out of his pocket. He
obviously could not exist on his pay: how, then,
did he live? That is a question soon answered.
A mail-guard going a long distance—anything
from a hundred to a hundred and fifty miles was
a usual spell—generally looked for half a crown
each from inside passengers and two shillings from
the outsides. If you could not afford so much he
would do with less, but then you lost the touch of
the hat that accompanied the larger sum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
A full coach produced 16<i>s.</i> in tips; or, if the
trip did not boast so good a waybill, guard and
coachman by prescriptive right divided all short
fares below 3<i>s.</i> A “good mail”—that is to say, a
mail on one of the great direct roads—loading well,
would produce sometimes as much as from £300 to
£500 a year in tips and fees for services rendered to
passengers and others. A guard’s income depended
mainly upon his attention and civility to passengers,
but there were many other sources. Before 1831
the sale of game was absolutely prohibited, yet a
great trade was done in it, with the mail and stage-guards
as intermediaries, and there can be no doubt
that the coaches afforded every opportunity that
poachers could desire of marketing the birds and
ground-game that fell to their guns or nets in the
darkling midnight woods.</p>

<p>Country squires knew this very well, and
threatened and fumed without ceasing, but they
or their keepers never by any chance saw those
roadside scenes familiar enough to passengers on
the up-mails; when, passing at midnight by some
dense woodland bordering the road, a low whistle
would be heard, and the coach would pull up while
a couple of men handed a sack over to the guard,
who, thrusting it into the hind-boot and stamping
the lid down, called out “Good-night!” and the
journey was resumed without comment. The
curious or suspicious might connect such an
incident with another which often happened on
entering London. “Jack,” the guard would sing
out, “Mr. Smith wants his luggage left at so-and-so,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
and the coach would be brought to a
momentary halt outside some public-house, and
the sack, from whose neck the inquisitive might
perhaps have seen something remarkably like
pheasants’ tails projecting, handed to an expectant
porter. Any interested person following that
porter would observe that the sack was delivered
at the nearest poulterer’s.</p>

<p>A guard pocketed half a crown each for all
bankers’ parcels he was entrusted with; he was
purveyor of tea and fish and buyer of meat to
a hundred villages down the road; netted many
a guinea from the lawyers in those days before
ever the Judicature Act was thought of, when
every answer filed in Chancery must needs be filed
by special and sworn messenger; had a penny each
for all letters picked up on the way, when post-offices
were few and far between; was entrusted
with great sums of money for payment into the
London banks; and purchased wedding-rings for
half the love-sick swains in a county. Every one
knew him, trusted him, and fed him, and if he was
a prudent man he had no difficulty in making
money at express speed. One guard, it is
recorded, was so earnest a fishmonger that he
used the Post Office bags to carry his fish in,
greatly to the disgust of the clerks, who found
themselves smothered in scales and surrounded by
a decidedly ancient, as well as fishlike, smell.
They complained to the Postmaster-General, who
reprimanded the delinquent, and with a quite
unintentional pun observed that the “sole” reasons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
of his not being dismissed were his good character
and long service.</p>

<p>The guard of the Southampton Mail had long
been suspected of smuggling, and at last the
Customs officers at that port, determined to search
the mail. They accordingly attempted to stop it
one evening, but the guard himself levelled his
blunderbuss at them, swearing he would blow out
the brains of the man who should lay a hand upon
the horses or seek to search “His Majesty’s Royal
Mail,” and so he got off, with the hind boot
stuffed to bursting with excisable but unexcised
goods in the nature of spirits and tobacco. A long
correspondence between the Postmaster-General
and the Commissioners of Customs arose out of this
incident, each official jealous of his own Department’s
rights as only Government officers can be;
but the Postmaster-General, although declaring
himself an enemy to smuggling, was indignant
at the idea of the mail being searched and
possibly detained; and although warning the
guard, approved his conduct. It needs no great
imaginative powers to picture that guard embarking
upon a colossal smuggling scheme after finding
himself thus secured from being searched.</p>

<p>Although the mail-guards were as a body a
brave and devoted class of men, determined to do
their duty and to carry his Majesty’s mails in
the face of all difficulties of snowstorms, winds,
and floods, yet they gave Thomas Hasker, Chief
Superintendent of Mail-coaches, a good deal of
trouble. They numbered 268, and he exercised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
the supreme control of them. Complaints continually
reached him from one quarter or another
of the mails being late, of the guards being
impertinent, and of the hind-boot, sacred to the
mail-bags, being used by the guards as a receptacle
for things quite unauthorised and unofficial. To
stop some of these practices he was obliged to issue
this notice, which reads somewhat curiously nowadays:
“In consequence of several of the mail-guards
having been detected in carrying meat and
vegetables in the mail-box, to the amount of 150
pounds weight at a time, the superintendents are
desired to take opportunities to meet the coaches in
their district, at places where they are least expected,
and to search the boxes, to remedy this evil,
which is carried to too great a length. The superintendents
will please to observe that Mr. Hasker
does not wish to be too hard on the guards. Such a
thing as a joint of meat, or a couple of fowls, or
any other article for their own families, in moderation,
he does not wish to deter them from the
privilege of carrying.”</p>

<p>Loading the roof with heavy or bulky articles
was a thing he could not allow as a usual thing.
“Such a thing as a turtle tied on the roof,
directed to any gentleman once or twice a year,
might pass unnoticed, but for a constancy cannot
be suffered.”</p>

<p>In one respect the lot of a mail-guard did not
compare favourably with that of his plebeian
brethren on the stage-coaches. He rode throughout
the night in a solitary position on the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
seat on the hind-boot called the “dicky,” with
the two outsides on the front part of the roof
facing away from him. It was a rule for many
years strictly enforced that the outside passengers
of a mail-coach should be limited to three: one on
the box-seat beside the coachman, and the other
two with their backs to the guard, as described.
It had its origin in the fear that, if more
were allowed, it would be an easy matter for
desperadoes to overpower coachman and guard,
and to rob the mail. For the same reason, the only
means of access to the hind-boot, in which the
mails were stowed away in those early days, before
the expansion of mail-matter caused the roof to be
piled up with great sacks of letters and packets,
was by a trap-door at the top, carefully locked,
and on which the guard had his feet placed during
the whole of the journey. Any infraction of the
rule against allowing a passenger on the hind part
of the coach was sure to bring instant dismissal,
and for permitting an extra passenger on the roof
the guard was fined £5.</p>

<p>But some of the joys of a mail-guard’s life are
recounted in the old <span class="locked">verses:—</span></p>

<p>Something of the old mail-guard’s welcome is
reflected in those lines. That he was, in the eyes
of the country folk a highly important personage
admits of no doubt, and that, even among the
upper classes, he was a trusted emissary and
purveyor of news is equally sure. He was, in
fact, news embodied. Winged Mercury might, in
the ancient world, and may be now, the personification
of intelligence, hot and hot; but from
1784 until the first railways began to outstrip the
mail-coaches, the mail-guards were the better type.
They brought the first rumours of joy or sorrow,
of victory or defeat, down with them on the Royal
Mail; and as we were warring almost incessantly
all over the world during the mail-coach era, few
were those occasions when the advent of these
official carriers was not awaited with bated breath.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
The tale has often been told how the mail-coaches,
carrying down with them the news of Trafalgar, of
Vittoria, and—culminating victory—of Waterloo,
went down into the country wreathed with laurel
and flying jubilant flags, and how the guards,
hoarse at last and inaudible from continual shouting,
resorted to the expedient of chalking the
words “Glorious Victory” in large letters on the
dickey, for the villagers to read as they dashed
along the roads. Often, under these circumstances,
a mail-guard was journalist as well, for when
he could string sentences together with a fair
approach to grammar, his contributions to the
provincial press were welcomed and well paid
for.</p>

<p>The duty of a mail-guard, besides the primary
one of protecting the mails, for which he was
provided with a blunderbuss, a pair of pistols, and
a cutlass carried in a case, was to see that time
was kept according to the official time-bill handed
to him. For the purpose of checking speed on the
road, and of keeping to that time-table, the Post
Office furnished every one of its guards with an
official time-piece enclosed in a wooden box in such
a way that it was impossible for any one to tamper
with it, or to alter the hands, without being
discovered. These clocks were regulated to gain
or lose so many minutes in twenty-four hours,
according to the direction in which the coach
travelled, in order that local time might be kept.
The timepiece was invariably carried in the leather
pouch with a circular hole cut in it that all mail-guards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
wore, so that the time could instantly be
seen.</p>

<p>To every guard the superintendent supplied a
list of instructions comprising twenty-six items.
Prominent among these was the obligation to date
and sign the time-bill correctly at every place,
or to see it signed and dated by the postmasters on
the way. How this was always accomplished in
snow and wind and rain, with numbed fingers,
is not easily understood. Often the time-bills
must have been reduced to something like pulp
by the time the trip was ended.</p>

<p>It was also the guard’s duty to report any
horses unfit for service, and any defective harness,
and to see that the coaches were in proper condition.
He was urged to look to the lamps, to behave with
civility to the passengers, and to sound his horn on
several occasions and in certain contingencies duly
specified.</p>

<p>Besides these ordinary official duties there were
the extraordinary ones, in the case of a breakdown
or in the event of a snowstorm. The guard had
his tool-box and an assortment of spare parts at
hand, so that he could help the coachman in
effecting roadside repairs to harness or the coach
itself; and when, from snowstorm or any other
cause, the coach could be driven no farther, it was
the guard’s duty to impress one of the mail horses
and ride to the next stage, or to secure post-chaises
or saddle-horses, and personally convey the mail-bags.
No matter what became of the passengers,
his first care was for His Majesty’s mails.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
Coachmen, although not the servants of the
Post Office, were fined heavily for being late, and
for stopping at unauthorised places, and the guards
were fined as well for allowing them to do so. To
one guard, who had been severely reprimanded for
not keeping time, and excused himself by saying
he could not get the passengers away from their
dinner, Hasker said, “Stick to your time-bill, and
never mind what passengers say respecting waiting
over-time. Is it not the fault of the landlord to
keep them so long? Some day, when you have
waited a considerable time (suppose five or eight
minutes longer than is allowed by the bill) drive
away and leave them behind. Only, take care
you have witness that you called them out two
or three times. Then let them get forward how
they can.”</p>

<p>Beyond his weekly half-guinea, an annual suit
of clothes, and a superannuation allowance of
seven shillings a week, a mail-guard had no official
prospects. It is true he might rise to become
a travelling inspector of mails, when he would
receive up to £100 a year, with 15<i>s.</i> a day
travelling expenses. But inspectorships were
naturally few, and in any case it is not conceivable
that a guard on a “good mail” would ever have
exchanged places with an inspector, who certainly
drew the higher salary but acquired no tips.</p>

<p>It has already been shown that guards did very
well indeed on the mainroad mails, and could very
well have afforded to take the situation without
any salary at all, or even, like waiters at modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
restaurants, to pay for the privilege of receiving
fees and tips. The salary was, in fact, merely
a nominal retaining-fee, to give the Department
a hold upon them. But there were a number of
cross-country mails that were not nearly so profitable
as those that ran direct from London, and
it is to be feared that their guards did not always
do so particularly well. Nor even did those on
the great mail-coaches keep their handsome incomes
at the last. Railways impoverished many a mail
before they were finally withdrawn, and it was
then that the guards agitated for higher salaries.
Their perquisites had reached the vanishing-point,
and at last the Post Office agreed to a new scale of
pay. From 1842 the guards were to receive from
£70 to £120 a year, according to length of service,
but at the same time were forbidden to receive
gratuities. This looks like a concession made by
some malevolent humorist, for already most of
the mails had been withdrawn.</p>

<p>But mail-guards were, as a class, more
fortunate than their brethren of the stage-coaches
when railways ran them off the road. It is true
that they keenly felt the loss of the great popularity
they had enjoyed, and more keenly still did
they miss the very handsome incomes they in
many instances had made; but as officials directly
employed by the Post Office, it was incumbent
upon that Department to find them employ or to
pension them. No such assured future could, or
did, cheer the lot of the coachmen of the mails, or
the coachmen or the guards of the stages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
The mail-guards in many instances were
drafted to the great railway stations, where they
assisted in despatching the mails by railway. Most
prominent among all whose career was thus
diverted was Moses James Nobbs, who died in
1897, half a century after the road as an
institution came to an end.</p>

<p>The career of this old servant of the Post Office
is, from a variety of circumstances, exceptionally
interesting. He was born on May 12th, 1817, at
Angel Street, Norwich, and was the son of a
coachbuilder. Entering the Post Office service on
June 27th, 1836, as guard of the London and
Stroud Mail, he was shortly transferred to the
Peterborough and Hull Mail, and then to the
Portsmouth and Bristol. In 1837 he was on the
new Exeter Mail, just started, on the accession
of Queen Victoria, to go through Salisbury
and Yeovil—-170 miles in 18¼ hours, doing the
journey to Exeter in two minutes’ less time
than the famous “Quicksilver” mail, which with
this year varied its route and, avoiding Salisbury
and Yeovil, went by the slightly shorter
route through Amesbury and Wincanton. Nobbs
went the whole distance, resting the following day.
The following year found him as guard on the
Cheltenham and Aberystwith Mail, on which he
remained until 1854—sixteen years of nightly
exposure on a route one hundred miles long,
through the difficult and mountainous districts
of mid-Wales. One of his winter experiences may
be given as a sample.</p>

  <div class="caption smaller hang">MOSES JAMES NOBBS, THE LAST OF THE
MAIL-GUARDS</div></div>

<p>“We had left Gloucester,” he says, “and
all went on pretty well until we came to Radnor
Forest, where we got caught in such a snowstorm
that it was impossible to take the coach
any farther, so we left it. I took the mail-bags,
and with the assistance of two shepherds made
my way over the mountains. It took us five
hours to get to the
other side, to an inn
at Llandewy. There
we met the up-guard,
Couldery, who took
my guides back
again. It was not
many hours before
the abandoned coach
was completely
covered with snow,
and there it remained
buried for a week.
Well, Couldery, it
seems, fell down in
the snow from exhaustion,
and had to
be carried by the
two shepherds to the ‘Forest’ inn, on the other
side of the mountain, and there he remained
for some days, to recover. I had to proceed
with my bags, so I got a chaise and pair from
Pen-y-Bont and another at Rhayader, but was
unable to take that very far owing to the snow.
There was nothing for it but to press on again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
on foot, which I did for many miles, until I came
to Llangerrig. There I found it was hopeless
to think of going over Plinlimmon, and was informed
that nothing had crossed all day; so I
made up my mind to go round by way of Llanidloes,
and a night I had of it! I was almost tired
out and benumbed with cold, which brought on
a drowsiness I found it very hard to resist. If
I had yielded to the feeling for one instant I
should not be telling these tales now. When
I got about eight miles from Aberystwith I found
myself becoming thoroughly exhausted, so I hired
a car for the remainder of the journey, and fell
fast asleep as soon as I got into it. On arriving
I was still fast asleep, and had to be carried to
bed and a doctor sent for, who rubbed me for
hours before he could get my blood into circulation
again. I had then been exposed to that terrible
weather for fifty hours. Next day I felt a good
deal better, and started back for Gloucester, but
had great difficulty in getting over the mountain.
I had the honour of receiving a letter from the
Postmaster-General complimenting me on my zeal
and energy in getting the mail over the mountain.
Even when there was no snow; the wind on the
top of Plinlimmon was often almost more than
we could contend with. Once, indeed, it was
so strong that it blew the coach completely over
against a rock; but we soon got that right again,
and always afterwards took the precaution of
opening both the doors and tying them back, so
that the wind might pass through the coach.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
On another occasion Nobbs and the mail
escaped in a miraculous manner. The snow had
been falling for many hours on Plinlimmon, and
it was a fearful night. They safely passed the
summit at Stedfa-gerrig, but, after going down
for a mile, lost their way in a dense combined fog
and snowstorm. A postboy was riding one of the
leaders, but he took the coach over a precipice
about sixty feet deep, and Nobbs and the coachman
performed two somersaults in the involuntary
descent. When they reached the bottom they
blessed that same snowstorm which they had been
regarding in quite another light, for the drifts
made a soft and safe resting-place. There were
only two passengers, who were, of course, riding
inside on such a night. They were greatly cut
by the breaking of the glass, and two horses were
killed. But in two hours the coach was righted,
and, having found an old Roman road in the
hollow and harnessed the two remaining horses,
they drove off, and actually succeeded in reaching
Cheltenham in time to catch the up London
mail.</p>

<p>When the Cheltenham and Aberystwith Mail
came off the road, in 1854, Nobbs was appointed
travelling inspector to the Post Office on the Great
Western Railway between Paddington and Exeter,
and was shortly afterwards transferred to Paddington,
where he remained for the rest of his official
career, superintending the receipt and despatch
of the mails until retired and pensioned off in
1891, under the Post Office regulations. He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
thus performed fifty-five years’ service, and had
seen the business of the Post Office grow from
the one hundredweight of mail-matter in his
charge on the Cheltenham and Aberystwith Mail
at Christmas 1839, to the twenty tons despatched
from Paddington on Christmas Eve 1889.</p>

<p>A very curious experience fell to the lot of
this veteran in 1887, when a revival of the old
days of the road took place, in consequence of the
Post Office deciding to send the London and
Brighton Parcel Mail by horsed van along that
classic highway instead of by rail. By the
Post Office agreement with the railway companies
of 1882, the year when the Parcel Post was
introduced, the companies were given 55 per
cent. of the total receipts; but as it presently
appeared that this was an extravagant proportion,
and that the parcels could be conveyed by van
along the road at a much smaller cost, the road
service now in force was at length inaugurated,
on June 1st, 1887.</p>

<p>To Nobbs, as the oldest guard in the service,
fell the distinction of acting in that capacity on
the Brighton Parcel Mail on its trial-trip. Again
he wore the gold-banded hat and the scarlet
coat, and sentimental souls not only provided
one of the old timepieces, but included a blunderbuss
in the equipment, while an even more
enthusiastic admirer of the bygone days produced
a key-bugle, so that Nobbs might play
“Auld Lang Syne.” He tried, but the attempt
was not a success. The results were feeble, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
consequence, as he explained, of his having lost
his front teeth.</p>

<p>Nobbs died, May 18th, 1897, in his eighty-first
year, at Uxbridge. His portrait is one of
the cherished items in the Post Office Record
Department.</p>

<p>One of those who, for some reason or another,
was not continued in Post Office employment
was an odd character popularly called “Cocky”
Murrell, who for many years afterwards was a
solicitor’s clerk at Downham Market, Norfolk.
“Cocky” he was called from his prodigious
amount of bounce. He had formerly been guard
of the mail between Ely and King’s Lynn, and
though not much taller than the horn he blew,
assumed as much authority as though he had

<span class="subhead">STAGE-COACH GUARDS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">Not</span> every stage-coach carried a guard, and
largely to that omission was due the prevalence
of accidents in the last years of coaching. When
we find guards first mentioned in old stage-coach
advertisements, shortly after the middle
of the eighteenth century, they were provided
strictly for the purpose their name indicates—to
guard the coaches against attack; and when
such dangers grew more remote they were
generally discontinued on day-coaches. Thus
very often, except on long-distance stages, even
the smart day-coaches carried no guard, and
when they did, his functions were not so much
to safeguard the coach in the original sense as
to help the coachman by skidding and unskidding
down hill, and to look after the way-bill and
the passengers’ luggage. It was when no such
useful functionary was carried, and when the
coachman, combining the parts, descended from
his box, and leaving the reins in charge of a
passenger, or often merely resting them on the
horses’ backs, went to explore the contents of
the boots, or alighted for some other necessary
business, that the horses often started off on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
their own accord and wrought disaster to coach
and passengers.</p>

<p>In early days, when horses were either not
changed at all on a long journey, or went
twenty-mile stages, nothing was less likely than
that they would bolt. All they wanted to do
was to lie down and die. But in the golden
age of coaching, when well-kept teams working
sometimes only six- or eight-mile stages were
usual, that coach-proprietor who, from motives
of economy or for any other reason, omitted
to provide a guard, should have been made
criminally responsible for any accidents caused
by that omission.</p>

<p>As a rule the guards of mails and stages
went from end to end, being responsible for
the contents of the way-bill. These spells of
from ten to fifteen hours’ duty were naturally
very tiring, and they generally rested the
following day, or, if in London, took the
opportunity of executing those varied commissions—from
the filing of a Bill in Chancery
to the matching of silks—of which every guard
had plenty always in hand.</p>

<p>An outstanding specimen of a stage-coach
guard is the figure of George Young, of the
Leeds “Union.” An excellent whip, as well
as guard, he was a man of a peculiar versatility
of genius, and as an entertainer of company on
the roof of a coach was probably unequalled in
his day. He transacted business commissions
for the better class of jewellers and attorneys,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
was fond of all kinds of sport, a successful
bookmaker, a good shot, went coursing, and
at horseracing was as keen as any tyke in broad
Yorkshire. Not insensible, either, to the charms
of the P. R., he introduced some noted bruisers
in his day, and was an intimate friend and
companion of Tom Spring. When not actively
engaged, he was always ready to take the ribbons
for a friend who wanted a holiday or had
urgent private affairs to attend to; and the
tooling of the teams, no matter how refractory,
never suffered in dignity from his manipulation.
He was, take him for all in all, perhaps one of
the most original and perfect specimens of the
old-fashioned, cheery, story-telling, and loquacious
sort who ever blew a horn, kissed a pretty
barmaid, pulled a sluggish team out of a difficulty,
or chaffed a yokel on his way to market.</p>

<p>This paragon among guards met his death
in April 1825, dying at the “Red Lion,” Pontefract,
of mortification resulting from an accident.
It seems that, to make room for an extra
passenger, he had given up the guard’s seat,
and went to sit beside the coachman, who
already had a passenger on the box. In order
not to inconvenience the coachman’s driving,
he sat on the edge of the seat, with one of his
legs dangling over the side, and so when the
coach gave a lurch, was thrown off and his
thigh broken.</p>

<p>Bob Hadley, guard of the “Unicorn” coach
between Manchester and the Potteries, was of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
the eccentric kind, sporting an odd kind of
headgear which went by the name of the “Hadley
Tile,” and was as well known in his circle as
the “D’Orsay Hat” was in fashionable London.
“It resembles,” said a contemporary, “an umbrella
in extent, and Bob, as he luxuriates under
its broad leaf, looks like an ourang-outang under
a banyan-tree. Some of his contemporaries having
adopted his taste too closely, he has been under
the necessity of extending its brim about four
inches, which puts all competition at defiance,
and he now presents an unique specimen. To
put himself still further beyond the reach of
envious competition, he has enclosed his delicate
person in a complete suit of plaid, from his
thorax to his trotters, and is now as complete
an original as is to be found in any zoological
collection in the Kingdom.”</p>

<p>It was in the very nature of their work that
the “up” and “down” coachmen and guards
should never meet, save in that moment of
passing one another on the road. Like the little
man and woman of the old-fashioned weather-gauge—the
one coming out and the other going
in, as fine or wet weather willed it—they could
not, in the ordinary routine, possibly enjoy one
another’s society. An exception was annually
made on the Holyhead Road, when a hundred
coachmen and guards were bidden to a feast at
the “Green Man,” Dunchurch. They managed
to find substitutes for their places on the box,
or on the guard’s seat, for the occasion, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
usually sat down to the half of a fat buck from
the Buccleuch estate adjoining that village.</p>

<p>The festival of September 1834 was a
memorable one. According to a contemporary,
the anticipation of the tuck-out had kept them
on the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">qui vive</i> for a week, and it was not a
little amusing to see them nearing the point of
attraction on the evening and night before; in
some cases two, and even three, being perched
on one coach and making the welkin ring with
notes of their bugles, in solos, duets, or trios,
to the no small interruption of the peaceful
slumbers of wayside hamlets, whose inhabitants,
from the constant din of “See the Conquering
Hero Comes,” fancied the Duke of Wellington,
at least, was on the road.</p>

<p>The guards of the Manchester “Red Rover”
were particularly on their stilts, and, having
met for the first time on the same vehicle in
musical fellowship, continued practising every
tune they did know and did not know, from the
time they quitted Highgate until they entered
Dunchurch, at about 3 a.m., when they took
leave of the coach with the splendid finale of
“We Won’t go Home till Morning,” leaving the
harassed passengers with the chance of an odd
wink for the remainder of the journey. “We
ought,” says the historian of these things, “as
faithful reporters, to state that Bob Hadley
and his chum on the ‘Rover’ occasionally
rested their pipes with a cigar or a song; and
in the latter attempt Hadley was certainly second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
best, for no raven in a chimney-pot could have
more barbarously murdered the airs of Rossini—so
much to the horror of a lady outside, who
was herself a bit of a musician, that she fancied
she had by accident got upon the railway, and
taken her seat in a cattle train, in one of the
private boxes set apart for the accommodation
of four-footed squeakers.”</p>

<p>The dinner on this occasion was of the most
substantial description, and, for want of a better,
Rob Hadley was put in the chair, a distinction
his modesty would have induced him to decline;
but the voices of the company were unanimous,
and on mounting his perch he returned thanks
on his bugle in the favourite hunting air of
“Old Towler”; which, as “on that day,” or
a few days before, a stag was supposed to have
died, was considered extremely appropriate, and
was applauded accordingly. Whether a stag
had died or not seemed subsequently to have
become a matter of doubt, for the chairman,
after carving the “noble haunch,” and coming
to the foot, which was enclosed with a profusion
of curled writing-paper, was not a little surprised
to find the hoof, instead of being <em>cloven</em>, to be
<em>entire</em>. A noted farrier present swore it was the
hoof of a young donkey! This the landlord
positively denied, but upon a jury being summoned
to decide the question, the hoof was
found to have mysteriously disappeared, and the
point remained for ever unsettled; although
it was freely hinted that the guard of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
“Emerald,” jealous at being shut out from the
feast, had conveyed the haunch away and substituted
for it the hind-quarter of a deceased
“Neddy” he had imported from Wolverhampton.</p>

<p>One of the most daring deeds ever related
of a guard was that well-nigh incredible one
told of the guard of the famous “Tantivy”:—</p>

<p>“We had just entered Oxford from Woodstock,”
says Lord William Lennox, “when
suddenly the horses started off at an awful pace.
What made matters worse was that we saw at
a distance some men employed in removing a
large tree that had fallen during the storm of
the previous night across the road near St.
John’s College. The coachman shook his head,
looking very nervous, while the guard, a most
powerful man, stood up, prepared for any emergency.
On we went, the coachman trying in
vain to check the galloping steeds, and we had
got within a few yards of the critical spot when
the guard, crawling over the roof, managed,
somehow or another, to get on the footboard,
when, with a spring, he threw himself on the
near wheeler, and with a giant’s clasp checked
the horses at the very moment the leaders
were about to charge the tree. Down they
came, but the guard never yielded an inch, and,
with the assistance of the country people near
at hand, the leaders regained their legs, without
the slightest damage to man, horse, coach, or
harness. A subscription for our gallant preserver
was got up on the spot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
The last twenty years of the coaching era
were remarkable for the development of musical
ability on the part of the guards, both of the
mail- and stage-coaches, who, relieved from their
old-time anxieties and fears of highwaymen, kept
their blunderbusses safely stowed away, and,
turning their attention, like so many scarlet-coated
Strephons, to the ballad-music of the
moment, became expert practitioners on the key-bugle.
That instrument came over from Germany
in 1818, and for a time pretty thoroughly displaced
the old “yard of tin” the earlier guards
had blown so lustily. The new generation
developed a passion for this strident kind of
minstrelsy. Like the hero (or is it heroine?) of
the “Lost Chord,” their “fingers wandered idly
over the sounding keys,” and although many
were expert players and, unlike the organist in
that song, <em>did</em> know what they were playing,
the jolting of the coaches must often have discomposed
their harmony to some extent, so that
the passengers could not always boast the same
knowledge.</p>

<p>Piccadilly, one of the chief starting-points in
London, was in this manner a highly musical
thoroughfare at the period now under review.
Ten guards, blowing ten different tunes at once,
produced, we are told—and can well believe—a
wonderful effect; and the roads became excruciatingly
lively when every gay young blood
of a guard learned to play “Cherry Ripe,” the
“Huntsman’s Chorus,” “Oh! Nanny, wilt Thou<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
gang wi’ Me?” and half a hundred others. The
passengers, like that famous young lady “with
rings on her fingers and bells on her toes,” had
music wherever they went. Let us hope they
appreciated their good fortune to the full.</p>

<p>The Post Office looked with a cold glance upon
these proceedings, and forbade mail-guards to play
the key-bugle. Those officials therefore purchased
them secretly, and snatched a fearful joy by producing
them when clear of London streets, and
playing, loud and long, such airs as “The Days
when we went Gipsying, a Long Time Ago,” and
“Sally in our Alley,” to the great admiration of
the country joskins. The performances of expert
players were said to be delightful, and no doubt
they quickly reaped in tips a harvest from what
they had expended on their instruments.</p>

<p>It is on record that a guard on the Chester
Mail, with the fear of God or public opinion
before him, always used to honour the Sabbath
Day by playing the “Old Hundredth” as the
coach passed through town and village, reserving
his secular tunes for the secluded highway.</p>

<p>Cornets-à-piston began to rival the key-bugle
in the last years of coaching, and the hurly-burly
grew terrific. To what lengths this progressive
din would have been carried had not the coaching
age itself come to an end let us not seek to
inquire; but when the coaching revival of 1863
and succeeding years brought back some of the old
sights and sounds of the road, key-bugles and their
like were very properly voted bad form, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
older coach-horn regained and still retains its
ancient ascendency. Those other instruments and
all their possibilities are left to modern beanfeasters
and Bank-holiday merrymakers, who, as the
suburban Londoner knows only too well, do not
fail to take full advantage of them.</p>

<p>What became of the stage-coach guards?
Some of them were killed, and thus never experienced
the bitterness of finding their occupation
gone. There is an inscription in the churchyard
at Great Driffield, Yorkshire, to one who ended
<span class="locked">thus:—</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center vspace">
TO THE MEMORY OF<br />
<span class="larger">THOMAS RUSSELL,</span></p>

<p class="center">Guard of the “Wellington,” who lost his life by<br />

<p class="center">Praises on Tomb Stones are but vainly spent;<br />

</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="in0">Less noticed by gossips on old coaching days than
the coachmen were, their ending is more obscure,
but it may be supposed that, like those occupants
of the box-seat, many of them settled down as
landlords of small inns in towns they had known
when they travelled the road.</p>

<span class="subhead">HOW THE COACHES WERE NAMED</span></h2>
</div>

<blockquote>
<p>“What’s in a name? Little enough, by the fact that people travel
by the Thame coach, the Hitchin chaises, and the Crawley stage.”—<i>Old
Coaching Essay.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="p2 in0"><span class="smcap">It</span> was not until quite late in the coaching era that
proprietors began generally to adopt the practice
of naming their coaches. In early days there was
little or no occasion to do so, for when there were
only two or three coaches on the most frequented
roads, no difficulty existed in distinguishing
between them. One might be the old original
stage; another, somewhat better built and more
up-to-date, would be the “Machine”; another yet,
fastest of all, the “Fly,” or the “Flying Machine.”
The earliest named coach of which we have any
record was the “Confatharrat” London and
Norwich stage, mentioned in 1695. As we have
already seen in these pages, this was an old-time
way of spelling the word “Confederate,” and the
coach was one probably owned and run by a
syndicate, who shared the risks and the profits.
Before competing coaches began to multiply and
hustle one another in the struggle for public
support, proprietors were content to announce
“a coach,” or “a stage-coach,” to run, and took
no trouble to characterise their vehicle in any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
more attractive fashion. But when an opposition
took the road, the vehicles so curtly named became
“commodious,” “easy,” “elegant,” and anything
else you like in the commendatory kind. The
next stage in this development was to appeal to
the sentiment of old customers and to endeavour
to retain their favour, not usually by increased
speed, lower fares, or better accommodation, but
by describing an old-established coach as “the
original.” Passengers, who did not lay so much
stress upon sentiment as upon personal comfort,
were generally well-advised to book seats by
the new opposition coaches rather than by the
“originals,” which had the defect of being old-fashioned,
and perhaps, in many cases, worn out.
Surely in no other business was rivalry so bitter
and unrelenting as in that of coaching, and the
annals of the road afford occasion for a sigh or
a smile as one reads the furious denunciations
levelled by one coach-master against another in
their old advertisements. This contention started
in the very first years of the Brighton Road. In
1757 James Batchelor extended his old Lewes
stage to Brighthelmstone (as Brighton then was
known). He took two days to perform the journey.
Five years later appeared a certain J. Tubb, allied
in partnership with S. Brawne, with intent to
drive Batchelor off the road. They advertised,
in May 1762, a “Lewes and Brighthelmstone
Flying Machine, hung on steel springs, very neat
and commodious,” to do the journey in one
day. This presumption aroused Batchelor, the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
incumbent, to extraordinary energy, for, the
very next week, he started a “new large Flying
Chariot,” and—reduced his fares! This reduction
of fares seems to have struck Mr. Tubb as an
exceedingly mean and contemptible move, and he
rushed into print with a very long and virulent
advertisement in the <i>Lewes Journal</i>, desiring
“Gentlemen, Ladies, and others” to “look
narrowly into the Meanness and Design of the
other Flying Machine to Lewes and Brighthelmstone
in lowering his prices, whether ’tis thro’
conscience or an endeavour to suppress me. If
the former is the case, think how you have been
used for a great number of years, when he
engrossed the whole to himself, and kept you two
days upon the road, going fifty miles. If the
latter, and he should be lucky enough to succeed
in it, judge whether he won’t return to his old
prices when you cannot help yourselves, and use
you as formerly.”</p>

<p>To this Batchelor rejoined with an appeal “to
the calm consideration of the Gentlemen, Ladies,
and other Passengers, of what Degree soever.”
This appeal was chiefly the time-honoured one,
that his coach was the original, and therefore
deserved support: “Our Family first set up the
Stage Coach from London to Lewes, and have
continued it for a long Series of Years, from
Father to Son and other Branches of the Same
Race. Even before the Turnpikes on the Lewes
Road were erected, they drove their Stage, in the
Summer Season, in one day, and have continued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
to do over since, and now in the Winter Season
twice in the week.” The Lewes and Brighton
Road seems, however, to have been long enough
and broad enough for both Tubb and Batchelor,
for they both continued until four years later,
when Batchelor died, and his business was sold to
Tubb, who took a partner, and himself in due
course experienced the bitterness of a rival on the
road, prepared with better machines, a speedier
journey, and lower fares.</p>

<p>About this time, when hatreds and rivalries
were seething in the south on this then comparatively
unimportant road, the Shrewsbury and
London road, on its several routes, by way of
Birmingham and Coventry, or by Oxford and
Banbury, was, as befitted so important a highway,
the scene of a much keener and more
protracted strife between opposing confederations
of coach-proprietors, and in consequence coach
nomenclature grew with the rapidity of melons
under a glass frame. It should be noted here
that coaching did not progress evenly all over
the kingdom, but was more advanced on some
roads than others. Thus, although the era of
“Machines” and “Flying Machines” did not
properly dawn until after 1750, yet on the
Bath Road we already find a “Flying Machine”
in 1667. Just as, nowadays, those people who
happen to reside on a branch line of some great
railway are commonly fobbed off with the secondhand
rolling-stock and other offscourings of the
main line, so the inhabitants along the lesser<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
roads had to be content with a mere “stage-coach,”
while the great trunk roads were
thronged with “machines” and “post-coaches.”</p>

<p>In 1753 the Shrewsbury “Long Coach” and
“Stage Coach” were started, and long continued;
but from 1764 things changed swiftly. In that
year the “Machine” began. The next spring
it had become the “Flying Machine,” and in
1773 its success had raised up a “New Flying
Machine,” soon re-christened the “New Fly.”
To the challenge of this “New Fly,” fitted,
according to its proprietors, “quite in the modern
taste” and with steel springs, the owners of the
“original London and Salop Machine” replied,
not only with the boast of being pioneers in
days of old, but (much more to the point)
advertised that their conveyance also was in the
modern taste and fitted with springs; and, moreover,
pointed out that the Coventry route, taken
by it to London, was shorter than that by Oxford,
taken by the rival firm.</p>

<p>“Machine” seems to have been a favourite
description for coaches at any time between
1754 and the beginning of the nineteenth century.
If the term had any specific meaning at all, and
was anything more than a vague, grandiose
way of advertising an ordinary stage, it must
originally have indicated a vehicle just in
advance of the usual ruck. The Bath “Flying
Machine” was probably of lighter build than
the other coaches, and the Edinburgh “new
genteel, two-end glass coach machine, on steel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
springs,” of 1754, was doubtless only a somewhat
neater example of a stage-coach than many then
in use on that route.</p>

<p>The next development was the “Diligence,”
conveying only three passengers and going at
the express rate necessary to cover the distance
between Shrewsbury and London in one day.
It went three times a week, and charged some
four shillings less than the “Flying Machine.”
Rivalries on this road had by this time quite
outgrown custom. In 1776 there were three
distinct coaches between Shrewsbury and London,
but they could not all pay their expenses, and
so were gradually taken off altogether, or ran
less frequently. The “Diligence,” which more
than any other had forced the pace, was itself
discontinued.</p>

<p>“Diligence” had now become a very popular
name for fast coaches, as speed was understood in
those times. It derived from across the Channel,
where conveyances known by this title had
already supplemented the ordinary slow-going
stage-coaches, called <em>carrosses</em>; but the importation
of the word into this country in connection with
stage-coaching was absolutely inexcusable, for
already our “Post Coaches” and “Light Post
Coaches” had begun to give the travelling public
an idea of quick transit.</p>

<p>The English “Diligence,” as originally built
and run upon the roads, was nothing more nor
less than a light coach, to hold three inside
passengers only, facing in the direction the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
coach travelled. It, indeed, greatly resembled,
if even it was not identical in every particular
with, the post-chaises of that time, themselves
built to hold three persons, and by that measure
of accommodation helping to prove every day
and upon roads innumerable the truth of the old
adage which declares that “Two’s company;
three’s none.” If, in fact, we come to the
conclusion that post-chaises were sometimes used
as “Diligences” and on other occasions as post-chaises,
we shall only be giving the proprietors
of coaches and chaises their due credit of being
clever business men, suiting their stock to the
needs of the hour.</p>

<p>Between the appearance of the Shrewsbury
“Diligence” and the opening of the nineteenth
century, “Diligences” abounded. The first
mail-coach was a “Diligence.” It is not to be
supposed that they were all fast; and indeed, so
early did the impudent slow coaches assume
the title, in order to deceive the public, that it
soon became a synonym for laziness and unpunctuality,
and so far were they in many cases
from being light coaches carrying only three
passengers, that references to them in the
literature of a hundred years ago mention as
many as six, or even eight persons.</p>

<p>The word “diligence” in some subtle manner
conveys a very true idea of these coaches. There
is in it something soothing and trustworthy. In
some vague way it radiates a calm atmosphere
of plodding virtue and slow-going innocence, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
which your dashing but breakneck “Tally-ho’s!”
and “Comets” are entirely strange. The “mind’s
eye, Horatio,” pictures in the progress of a
Diligence a patient toiling against difficulties,
rewarded in the end by the happy issue of an
arrival at one’s inn, weary perhaps with long
hours of travel, but still sound in body; an ending
not always so comfortable when travelling by
the swift “Tally-ho’s” and “Comets” aforesaid.
Then, too, when “Diligence” became shortened
into “Dilly,” as it very soon was, the title grew
in a sense poetic. The “Derby Dilly,” which,
faithful among the faithless, would appear to have
remained really and truly a Diligence, has in fact
been celebrated in verse by no less an one than
Canning, in the lines contributed by him to the
<i>Loves of the Triangles</i>:—</p>

There were those ingrates who, contemporary
with the Diligences, did not appreciate them very
highly. They valued speed more than safety.</p>

<p>“You should have called it the Sloth,” said the
traveller at the Hawes Inn, somewhere about
1790, referring to the “Hawes Fly, or Queen’s-ferry
Diligence,” which then plied between Edinburgh
and the shores of the Forth; “why, it
moves like a fly through a glue-pot.”</p>

<p>It is now necessary to turn aside for awhile to
contemplate the final debasement of the Diligence,
which in 1835 became, in the hands of Mr. George
Shillibeer, something very like an omnibus. In
1829 he had introduced a line of public vehicles
running from Paddington to the City, and had
himself named them “omnibuses”; but in 1835
he appeared with a long-distance vehicle which he
put on the Brighton Road and named “Shillibeer’s
Improved New Patent Diligence.” By this, three
classes of accommodation were provided: the
“Coupé or Chariot,” to convey three persons, at
£1 1<i>s.</i> each; behind it, in a separate compartment,
the “Omnibus,” to hold eight, at 16<i>s.</i>; and the
“Exterior,” as he somewhat grandly named the
roof, accommodating an indefinite number at 10<i>s.</i>
each. Shillibeer was a great advertiser, and gave
this, as well as his omnibuses, due publicity. He
was inordinately fond of advertisements cast in a
metrical form, and accordingly his tame poet was
made to grind out a set of halting verses which
fully describe the beauty and convenience of his
master’s new <span class="locked">enterprise:—</span></p>

Poor Shillibeer, however, came to an unfortunate
crisis in his affairs in this very year, when
the omnibuses he put on the road between London
and Greenwich had been running in ruinous competition
with the new London and Greenwich
Railway, and had brought him so very low,
financially, that he was unable to meet the
demands of the Stamp Office for the duty payable
on the vehicles. The Office seized his omnibuses,
and presumably his Diligence as well, for we hear
nothing more of it, and his mellifluous songster no
longer enlivened the pages of the public prints
with his rhymes. There was a Diligence on the
Brighton Road in the following year, but it was
owned by another firm, who made a better performance,
for their conveyance did the journey
in 5¼ hours, and the fares were much cheaper.
Passengers by coupé paid 16<i>s.</i>, by second class
12<i>s.</i>, and outsides only 8<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Meanwhile, “Post Coaches” and “Light Post
Coaches” were at the head of the coaching
hierarchy. Introduced long before mail-coaches
came into being, they were then the most expensive
and exclusive, as they were also the
speediest, of public conveyances, and ranked
next after the post-chaises. They were expensive
chiefly because they provided only limited
accommodation; originally only three or four
inside, and one or two out, with no luggage,
except small trunks or parcels. The term “Post”
had no reference to the Post Office, but was
intended to give at once an idea of speed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
an approach to that absolute privacy only obtained
by specially hiring a post-horse or a post-chaise.
Indeed, the earliest Post Coaches not a little
resembled a post-chaise hired by a party of friends
for the journey. In securing a seat by post-coach,
the traveller, in view of the limited accommodation,
mathematically reduced his chances
of meeting and journeying with vulgar and
objectionable characters; while the higher fare
tended to produce the same effect by eliminating
all but those who were rich enough to afford
the cost, and were therefore, by an easily understood
process of reasoning, likely to be cleanly
and well-mannered. How highly objectionable
the company in a stage-coach might and could
be we have the testimony of many travellers to
tell, from Dean Swift to John Wesley and
Macready, the actor. Their trials and experiences
are mostly recorded elsewhere in these pages;
but two examples may take their place here to
illustrate the reason why Post Coaches flourished
so greatly.</p>

<p>Let us, then, hear <span class="locked">Wesley:—</span></p>

<p>“I went,” he says, “to Norwich (from London)
in the stage-coach with two very disagreeable
companions, called a gentleman and gentlewoman,
but equally ignorant, insolent, lewd,
and profane.</p>

<p>“<i>July 21st, 1779.</i>—(From Coventry) I took
coach for London. I was nobly attended: behind
the coach were ten convicted felons, loudly
blaspheming and rattling their chains; by my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
side sat a man with a loaded blunderbuss, and
another upon the roof.”</p>

<p>The felons, “behind the coach,” would ride
in the basket, which was without springs. Their
chains would necessarily rattle, and considering
the discomfort of ten manacled men, jammed
together, without seats, and jolted over bad roads,
it is not surprising they “blasphemed.”</p>

<p>Macready travelled in 1811 by the Liverpool
stage, from Birmingham to London. He <span class="locked">says:—</span></p>

<p>“I got into the coach; its odours were many,
various, and unpleasantly mingled, and the
passengers, a half-drunken sailor and an old
woman, did not impress me with the prospect of
a very pleasant journey. The pace at which
the vehicle proceeded made me doubt whether it
would ever reach London, and its creakings and
joltings seemed to augur a certain overturn.”
This objectionable conveyance took five hours to
accomplish the eighteen miles between Birmingham
and Coventry, and only reached London at five
o’clock the next evening.</p>

<p>But there is no subject upon which it is
more rash to generalise than that of coaching
history. One road might be thirty or forty
years in advance of another, and Diligences and
Post Coaches mean things very different in one
part of the country from conveyances similarly
named, but of different construction and capacity,
running in other districts. In 1782, for example,
there was a self-styled “Post Coach” running
between London, Maidenhead, and Marlow, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
certainly did not fully answer the description
given above; although, from the evidence of the
very curious old painting, it still retained a
certain elegance, in spite of carrying outsides,
and owning that vulgar appendage, a “basket,”
behind. This Post Coach, which in the contemporary
painting bears its name, starting-point,
and place of destination plainly to be seen, is
first heard of in 1773, running daily from the
“King’s Head,” Old Change, at noon. What
the fare was to Marlow we have not been able
to discover, but to Maidenhead, distant from the
City 31 miles, it was 5<i>s.</i></p>

<p>“Accommodation” coaches abounded all over
the country from about 1800. They were generally
slow coaches, with ample room, travelling
along the roads in leisurely fashion, and stopping
anywhere and everywhere, to pick up passengers
and luggage. The nearest parallel to them
nowadays is the slow, stopping, long-distance
train, which halts at every little wayside station
and sees the express flash by at sixty miles an
hour.</p>

<p>Thus far we have recorded chiefly the titles
by which types of coaches were known. We
now come to coaches individually named. Early
among these is the “Rockingham,” London and
Leeds stage, established in 1781, and continued
until the railway came to Leeds, in 1841.
Rockingham was, indeed, a name to conjure
with in Yorkshire, and there were at least two
other coaches with that name running on branch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
roads from Leeds. The “True Blue” was the
name of the old Leeds, Malton and Scarborough
coach, originating in the same year as the
“Rockingham,” and lasting three years longer.
Three others ran between Leeds and Wakefield,
Knaresborough and Selby, and Leeds and Bradford.
“True Britons,” too, were plentiful in the broad-acred
county of Yorkshire, where politics and
patriotism kept parties at fever heat and divided
even travellers into parties to such an extent
that an ardent supporter of the “Buffs” would
almost rather walk or post than journey by a
“Blue” coach; while a True Blue Tory innkeeper
would deny accommodation to a Buff
Whig (supposing in the first instance that the
Whig had so far forgotten what was due to
his faction as to seek shelter there) and think
nothing of the custom lost.</p>

<p>In 1784 the “Expedition” coach is first
mentioned as running between London and
Norwich, by way of Newmarket and Thetford.
The “expedition” consisted in going 108 miles
in 17½ hours, including stops, or a net running
speed of about seven miles an hour.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>THE “READING TELEGRAPH,” PASSING WINDSOR CASTLE.<br />
<span class="fright"><i>After J. Pollard.</i></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>“Balloon” coaches were first heard of in
1785, when a plentiful scattering of that name
over the country proved how deep an impression
had been made upon the public mind by the
balloon ascents of Lunardi in the previous year.
A stone monument marks the spot beside the
Cambridge Road, near Ware, on which that
aerial traveller descended after his first flight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
in this country; and the coaches long carried an
echo of the wonderment then excited. Coach-proprietors
had, indeed, by this time begun to
see the commercial advantage of impressing the
public with a sounding name. Already, by long
use and wont, cars had become blunted by the
name of the Flying Machines, which had fallen
unmeaningly upon several generations accustomed
to liberally discount the absurd pretension. No
one at this time, it is safe to say, ever received
a mental impression of flying when a flying
coach was named. The name had become a mere
convention. The Balloon was therefore a godsend
to coach-proprietors who, in naming their
conveyances after it, succeeded for a while in
reviving an outworn figure of speed, and thus
again suggested the idea of their coaches gracefully
navigating the empyrean, rather than painfully
staggering along the rutty roads.</p>

<p>The “Defiance” coaches bring us closer to
the great Augustan era of smart coaches and
great emulation along the road. The earliest
coach of this name was put on the Leeds and
Hull road in 1784, and became the parent of many
more. Extraordinary ingenuity was used in the
selection of “telling” names, supposed to instantly
discover the character of a coach to travellers.
The various “Highflyers,” for example, spoke to
sporting men of a speed that might be neck or
nothing. The typical sportsman would book by
the “Highflyer,” the “Vixen,” “Spitfire,” the
“Flying Childers,” “Lightning,” or “Rapid,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
while the typical parson would go by the “Regulator,”
the “Reliance,” or, best of all, if opportunity
offered, by the “Good Intent.”</p>

<p>It is curious to note in how arbitrary a geographical
manner these names were distributed.
It is no use seeking a “Highflyer” in the
history of the Brighton Road. “Highflyers”
were Yorkshire products, and almost exclusively
confined to the Great North Road and its
affluents. There, indeed, they were numerous.
The old original of the name was started in
1788, and kept the road between London and
Edinburgh until 1840. There were at least
six others.</p>

<p>“Telegraph” coaches, however, were not
peculiar to any one road or district. Introduced
about 1781 on the Leeds and Newcastle road,
there were two others in Yorkshire, and in 1805
and 1811 “New Telegraph” and “Telegraph”
coaches were on the Brighton Road. In the
’twenties a “Southampton Telegraph,” a “Manchester
Telegraph,” and a “Reading Telegraph”
flourished; while beyond all others in their
fame and exploits were the immortal “Exeter
Telegraph,” started in 1826 by Mrs. Ann Nelson,
of the “Bull,” Aldgate, to travel the 173 miles
between Piccadilly and Exeter in 17 hours,
and the “Manchester Telegraph” day coach of
1833, doing 180 miles in 18 hours. Before the
advance of the Great Western Railway brought
the “Exeter Telegraph” off the road, it had
cut down the length of the journey by three
hours, Coaches rejoicing in this name—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
synonym for speed—were necessarily the fastest
on the road, but they did not, of course, obtain
the title from the electric telegraph, invented
only in 1838. It was derived from the system
of semaphore signalling, the quickest method of
communication then known, by which messages
were signalled between London and the coast,
from lofty hills even yet marked on the Ordnance
maps, “Telegraph Hill.” Of how inconceivably
swift telegraphy would in a comparatively short
time become, the old coach-proprietors could have
had not the remotest inkling, but they did not
suffer from excess of modesty, and had the instantaneous
signalling of electricity been known
in their time, it would by no means have deterred
them from christening their coaches in impudent
rivalry with it.</p>

<span class="fright"><i>After J. A. Atkinson.</i></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>The “Exeter Telegraph” was put on to
compete with another, and equally famous,
coach, the Devonport Mail, generally known in
coaching annals as the “Quicksilver.” This
celebrated mail started about 1820. Passing
through Exeter, it went on to Plymouth and
Devonport, and performed the whole journey in
21 hours 14 minutes, an average speed, including
stops, of 10 miles 1¾ furlongs an hour. “Quicksilvers,”
of course, became fashionable on other
roads after the fame of this performance had
spread.</p>

<p>Our great wars with France and Spain gave
coaches a plentiful crop of titles, taking a higher
note than merely that of party. The victory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
of Trafalgar and the death of Nelson, in
1805, produced innumerable “Nelsons,” “Lord
Nelsons,” and “Trafalgars,” only rivalled in
popularity by the “Wellingtons” and “Waterloos”
ten years later. Even Blucher was
honoured, in a coach named after him. Coach-proprietors,
in fact, were keen to seize the
popular incident of the hour, the hero of the
day, or the name of the local magnate, to reflect
a certain glory upon, or bespeak affection for,
their enterprises. Even the “Union” coaches,
which were christened in honour of that great
political event, the Union of Great Britain and
Ireland, and were from that date to be found
on almost every great road, and in incredible
numbers on the bye-roads, paled their lustre
before those named after the naval and military
heroes, or the glorious victories of the hour.</p>

<p>But when the glamour of the great achievements
won on land and sea by generals and admirals
and by our soldiers and sailors had waned, as
it speedily did when peace came and the nation
was called upon to pay the bill, it is to be
feared that the “Wellingtons” and “Nelsons”
did not run so frequently with a full way-bill
as they had done, and that opportunist coach-proprietors
in many cases renamed them in
styles that more exactly fitted the humours of
the time. When the comets of 1811 and 1818
appeared, flaming in the heavens, to excite the
wonderment of the learned and to terrify the
ignorant, the coach-proprietors were early in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
the field to take advantage of the event, and
“Comet” coaches, intended to strike the public
fancy with an idea of swift travelling, appeared
on the main routes with amazing unanimity.</p>

<p>The Brighton “Comet,” established in 1815, ran
until 1840, when the London and Brighton Railway
was opened. It experienced a good many
mishaps in the course of those twenty-five years.
On September 2nd, 1815, when it had arrived
at Castle Square, Brighton, and had discharged
most of its passengers, the coachman turned it
so sharply that the front wheels became locked,
and in the endeavour to release them the
coach was overturned. The careless coachman
was himself seriously hurt, and a lady, an inside
passenger, and a gentleman on the outside
much bruised; but a Mr. Walker, who had
just mounted the coach, had his leg broken.
The “Comet” evidently went through Epsom,
for it was there that another accident happened
to it in later years. That coach carried no
guard, and the coachman had, therefore, to act
that part, as well as drive. He climbed down
to take up a passenger, and while doing so the
horses backed the coach into a bank and caused
it to fall over. A lady travelling outside had
her ribs broken. A third accident was due
largely to the interference of a passenger, who
met his death in consequence. The “Comet”
had on this occasion nearly completed its down
journey, when, at Patcham, the reins became
entangled in some unexplained manner. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
Mr. Schraeder, who was on the box-seat, travelling
to Brighton to join his family, made an effort,
despite the protests of the coachman, to get down
to disentangle them, when he fell between the box
and the horses, and the coach ran over him. The
“Comet” ran to the “Swan with Two Necks,” in
Lad Lane, and seems, from Pollard’s spirited
picture, to have been an exceptionally smart coach.</p>

<p>The great era of coaching, with its attendant
competition, opened about 1820, and from that
time the “Defiances,” the “Celerities,” the
“Rapids,” “Expresses,” “Reindeers,” “Darts,”
“Stags,” and “Antelopes” increased; while
fiercely militant titles, such as those of the
“Retaliator,” the “Spitfire,” “Vixen,” “Fearless,”
“Dreadnought,” and “Invincible” reflected
the extraordinary bitterness and animosity with
which that competition was conducted. The
reverse of this unamiable feature is seen in the
names—breathing a spirit of goodwill, or at least
of meekness, reliability, and inoffensiveness—of
the “Amity,” the “Live and Let Live,” “Hope,”
“Endeavour,” the “Give and Take,” “Reliance,”
“Safety,” “Regulator,” “Perseverance,” “Good
Intent,” and “Pilot” coaches. It is probable that
some of these titles were given by small proprietors,
anxious to disclaim rivalry with more
powerful men. Others were intended to secure
the patronage of the old ladies and the timorous,
and all those to whom coach travelling, with its
many accidents and hairbreadth escapes, was a
disagreeable necessity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
To reassure the old ladies of both sexes such
coaches as the “Patent Safeties” were introduced.
Many of those so called were neither safe nor
patent, but an exception must be made in the case
of the coach invented and patented in December
1805 by the Reverend William Milton, Vicar of
Heckfield, near Reading. This gentleman, who
yearned for a larger sphere of action than that
provided by his rural parish, and apparently did
not find his duties sufficient to occupy his time,
studied the subject, and produced a book in whose
pages he sets forth the design of his coach and
its superiority over anything that had hitherto
appeared on the road. His principle not only
consisted in lowering the body of the vehicle upon
its axles, so reducing the centre of gravity, but in
addition provided a luggage box in the rear of the
coach, hung so low that it was only fourteen
inches from the ground. His idea was to carry
the luggage thus, instead of on the roof, so rendering
it less top-heavy, and indeed, according to his
theory, making the luggage act as ballast, so that
the heavier the coach loaded, the safer it would
be. Nor was this all. As a protection against
overturning in the case of a wheel coming off, he
provided what he called a small “idle wheel,”
fitted to the axle a short distance inside each
running wheel. In the event of a wheel flying
off, the coach would only dip slightly, and run on
the “idle wheel” until the coachman could bring
the whole affair to a stop.</p>

<p>Of course this inventive clergyman found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
the greatest indifference among coach-proprietors
towards his patent safety coach. His book reflects
the disappointment he felt, and he enlarges upon
the folly of men who had, time and again, been
heavy losers in paying compensation claims by
injured passengers, and yet would not try the
merits of a vehicle which would save them in
pocket and in anxiety. He at last gave an order
to a firm of coach-builders, had one built to his
own design, and prevailed first upon one of
the London and Reading proprietors, and then
the owners of a Stroud coach, to try it. The
general feeling seems to have been that it was
safe, but slow, and did not possess so easy a
draught as that of the usual build. To these
arguments he replied by saying that his luggage-box,
providing room for more goods and luggage
than carried on ordinary coaches, was generally
filled with heavy consignments sent by the Stroud
clothiers, and that the heaviness of draught was
due to that cause. But explanations of weight,
demonstrations of safety, and even the recommendations
he had procured from a Parliamentary
Committee, were useless, and Milton’s Patent
Safety Coach was never more than a fugitive
occupant of the road.</p>

<p>But still the public, horrified by the increasing
number and the disastrous nature of the accidents
that strewed every road with groaning passengers,
were intent upon being carried safely, and so
various attempts were made to reassure them. So
many accidents had happened on the Brighton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
Road, incomparably the most travelled of all, that
in the spring of 1819 it was thought necessary by
a prominent firm of coach-proprietors to introduce
a “safety” coach. This was the “Sovereign,” an
entirely new departure in coach-building. It was
at once larger and lighter than an ordinary coach.
“It weighs,” said the <cite>Brighton Herald</cite>, “only
1500¼ lb.; which is 400 lb. lighter than the
average of coaches built to carry luggage, and
80¾ lb. less than some gentlemen’s landaus. The
different coachmen who have driven it say that on
level ground it runs much lighter than others, and
every mechanic knows that small wheels have
the advantage at a hill.” Evidently then, the
“Sovereign” was built with smaller wheels than
were usual. It was, in addition, five inches
broader in the gauge of the axletrees, while,
according to the official description, the weight of
the body was “placed five feet lower, so that when
the wheels on one side are thrown off, the axle
drags on the ground, and will allow the remaining
wheels to be lifted twelve inches or more before
the coach loses its balance. If a wheel had been
thrown off any other coach while going at the rate
of nine miles an hour with two outside passengers,
it must have gone over; but should it take place
with the safe coach, it will not incline on one side
so as to make passengers uncomfortable.”</p>

<p>The appearance of this affair was extraordinary.
It carried no outsides on the roof; they were
placed in a fore-carriage like the body of a landau,
constructed between the box and the body of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
coach. Under the box was “a spacious lock-up
receptacle for the stowage of luggage”; so it was
a “safety” coach in more than one particular,
and the local newspaper was of opinion that “the
confidence which manufacturers and dealers have
of their valuable property being secured from wet
and pilfering is enough to secure for it the most
decided preference, independently of its personal
safety.” So great was the interest taken at
Brighton in this pioneer of safety coaches that
an enormous crowd of nearly two thousand persons
assembled to witness the departure on its first
journey, Sunday, March 21st, 1819. It made the
passage to London in six hours; a speed quite up
to the level of the usual performances.</p>

<p>The popularity of the “Sovereign” was so
great and immediate that other coach-proprietors
lost no time in having “safeties” built. The next
to take the road was the “Umpire,” in July of the
same year, followed by the “Dart” and “Hero.”
These were all swift, as well as safe. A similar
Patent Safety was Matthews’s coach. The proprietor
of the “Comet” adopted it for a time, as
shown in the old print engraved here.</p>

  <div class="caption">MATTHEWS’ PATENT SAFETY COACHES ON THE BRIGHTON ROAD.</div></div>

<p>The inevitable debasement of the specific term
“safety,” and its general application at the whim
of proprietors, quite irrespective of safety construction,
is found beginning in 1821, with the
advertisement of Whitchurch, Best &amp; Wilkins,
of Brighton, in which, while the public were
reminded that the firm were the first to run a
coach to London in six hours, returning the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
day, stress was laid upon the fact that this quick
service had been continued daily for six years
without an accident. Experienced coachmen,
steady horses, and a stern discouragement of
racing had procured this desirable immunity, and
so (the advertisement continued) it was hoped the
public would not deem the proprietors presumptuous
in claiming the privilege of calling the
coach, although not a patent, a safety. Alas for
these pioneers of quick transit and sticklers for
decent conduct on the road! The firm very soon
decayed, and Whitchurch, the senior partner, was
brought to poverty.</p>

<p>To follow the history of the “safety”
coaches and the pseudo-“safeties” would be a
long business, but it may be said that these
specially constructed vehicles did not long continue,
and that the average stage-coach passenger
took the claims of all very much on trust. To
show that he did so we need only quote the
anecdote related by “Viator Junior” in the
<i>Sporting Magazine</i> of 1828, at the expense of
the “Patriot” coach, then newly provided with
Cooke’s protection <span class="locked">reins:—</span></p>

<p>“Just as Pickett was starting with his
‘Union’ coach out of Holborn, up comes a
pursy old citizen, puffing and blowing like a
grampus.</p>

<p>“‘Pray, coachman, is this here the Patriotic
Life-Preserver Patent Safety Coach?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, sir,’ says Pickett, not hearing above
half his passenger’s question; ‘room behind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
sir: jump up, if you please—very late this
morning.’</p>

<p>“‘Why, where’s the machinery?’ cries the
old one.</p>

<p>“‘There, sir,’ replies a passenger (a young
Cantab, I suspect), pointing to a heavy trunk
of mine that was swung underneath, ‘in that
box, sir, that’s where the machinery works.’</p>

<p>“‘Ah!’ quoth the old man, climbing up,
quite satisfied: ‘wonderful inventions nowadays,
sir. We shall all get safe to Brighton: no
chance of an accident by <em>this</em> coach.’”</p>

<p>The Brighton Road, as already hinted, was
in many ways exceptional. It had exceptionally
many Royal associations, reflected vividly enough
in the names of its coaches. Among these was,
of course, the “Prince Regent,” started in 1813,
but preceded by the “Princess Charlotte,” established
a year earlier, and followed by the
“Regent,” “Royal George,” “Royal Adelaide,”
“Royal Clarence,” “Royal Sussex,” “Royal
Victoria,” and “Royal York.”</p>

<p>Later sporting names for coaches than the
“Tally-ho’s” and the “Highflyers” were such
as the “Bang Up,” the “Hieover”—surely no
prudent person travelled by a coach with a name
so suggestive of broken necks—and the “High-mettled
Racer,” while the gay young bloods
who drove the crack Windsor coach called it,
after the first <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">danseuse</i> of that time, the
“Taglioni.” The “Taglioni” was a fast coach,
driven by fast men, and had a picture of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
Taglioni herself, pirouetting round on the tips
of her toes, painted prominently on the body.
But of all the sporting names, that of the
“Tantivy” breathes most the classic spirit of
that sporting age, and called forth one of the
coaching classics, written in regretful anticipation
of coaches being supplanted by railways. The
“Tantivy Trot” was written by Egerton Warburton,
of Arley, Cheshire. It was sung to
the air of “Here’s to the Maiden of Bashful
Fifteen,” and was an especial favourite with
the brazen-throated young sportsmen of the
Bullingdon <span class="locked">Club:—</span></p>

<p>It is a long set of verses, but it should not
be difficult, if any one had the mind to it, to
continue them indefinitely. In truth, they limp
not a little, and do not go the swinging pace
of the “Tantivy” itself. But this was the best
the old-time enthusiasm for the road could
produce, and that it should have been so popular
at coaching festivities shows that although coachmen,
amateur and professional, were severe critics
of other coaching matters, they were sufficiently
indulgent to literary efforts on this especial
theme.</p>

<p>Rowland Eyles Egerton Warburton, who wrote
the “Tantivy Trot” in 1834, at the request of
Charles Ford for something to celebrate the
Birmingham “Tantivy” coach, was regarded by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
the sporting world as its laureate. He was
the squire of Arley Hall, Cheshire, and the
owner of many fat acres in that county. He
outlived the coaching age by many a long day,
and died in 1891 in his 88th year. The last
sixteen years of his life were saddened by the
affliction of total blindness.</p>

<span class="subhead">GOING BY COACH: BOOKING OFFICES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">Journeys</span> by coach were entered upon by our
grandfathers with much deliberation. It was
not then a matter of suddenly making up one’s
mind to go somewhere, and going accordingly,
with only a few minutes’ preparation. The first
step was to book one’s seat, a formality then
absolutely necessary, and in most cases some days
before the journey was proposed to be taken.
Only by doing so could one be sure of finding a
place. The nearest modern parallel to this custom
is the booking of passages on ocean steamers;
and a relic of it may be observed every day at
every railway station where the name of “Booking
Office” instead of Ticket Office is a survival—like
that of the official railway designation of
carriages and passenger returns as “coaches”
and “coaching traffic”—of customs gone, never
to return.</p>

<p>The passengers by coach were actually, as the
term implies, “booked.” The booking clerk did
not merely give one a ticket in exchange for the
fare. He entered the passenger’s name and all
necessary particulars in a huge ledger, and in
this identical manner the first railway passengers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
secured their places, until the mere work of
entering these details became too great.</p>

<p>The booking-clerks in coach-offices had their
responsibilities, and were kept up to the highest
mark of efficiency by the knowledge that if they
fell into such an error as overbooking a coach on
any particular journey, not only would the proprietors
be bound in law to by some means convey
those passengers for whom there was no room,
but that the extra cost of so doing would infallibly
be deducted from their wages. The loss in such
cases would inevitably be heavy, but dependent
upon the length of the journey. Mistakes of this
kind generally meant that the extra passengers
were conveyed by post-chaise, at anything from
ninepence to a shilling a mile; and it was the
difference between these rates and the coach-fares
of from twopence to fivepence a mile that the
clerks had to make good, unless the overbooked
passengers were sufficiently good-natured to wait
for another coach.</p>

<p>The usual practice on securing a place was to
pay a proportion—generally one-half of the fare—down,
and the other half on taking one’s seat,
as noted in the contemporary doggerel, which
<span class="locked">declared:—</span></p>

If you did not put in an appearance, the deposit
was, of course, forfeited.</p>

<p>Dickens, who as a reporter in his early years
was very intimately acquainted with coach travelling
and all the manners and customs connected
with it, has left a very picturesque description of
a coach booking-office and its occupants. The first
impression received by the prospective traveller
was of his own unimportance. One entered
a mouldy-looking room, ornamented with large
posting-bills, the greater part of the place enclosed
behind a huge lumbering rough counter, and
fitted up with recesses like the dens of the smaller
animals in a travelling menagerie, without the
bars. At these booking-offices, in fact, one booked
parcels as well as passengers, and into these
recesses the parcels were flung, with an air of
recklessness at which the passenger who might
have chanced to buy a new carpet-bag that
morning would feel considerably annoyed.</p>

<p>The booking-office to which Dickens here refers
was at the “Golden Cross,” Charing Cross; but
booking-offices were all very much alike, and were
exceedingly dreary and uncomfortable places,
resembling modern offices for the reception of
<span class="locked">parcels:—</span></p>

<p>“Porters, like so many Atlases, keep rushing
in and out, with large packages on their shoulders;
and while you are waiting to make the necessary
inquiries, you wonder what on earth the booking-office
clerks can have been before they were
booking-office clerks; one of them, with his pen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
behind his ear, and his hands behind him, is
standing in front of the fire like a full-length
portrait of Napoleon; the other, with his hat
half off his head, enters the passengers’ names in
the books with a coolness which is inexpressibly
provoking; and the villain whistles—actually
whistles—while a man asks him what the fare is outside—all
the way to Holyhead!—in frosty weather
too! They are clearly an isolated race, evidently
possessing no sympathies or feelings in common
with the rest of mankind. Your turn comes at
last, and, having paid the fare, you tremblingly
inquire—‘What time will it be necessary for me
to be here in the morning?’ ‘Six o’clock,’
replies the whistler, carelessly pitching the
sovereign you have just parted with into a
wooden bowl on the desk. ‘Rather before than
arter,’ adds the man with the semi-roasted unmentionables,
with just as much ease and complacency
as if the whole world got out of bed
at five. You turn into the street, ruminating, as
you bend your steps homewards, on the extent
to which men become hardened in cruelty by
custom.”</p>

<p>The long-distance coaches—divided into the
“day” and “night” varieties—started very early
in the morning, or late in the afternoon. The
midday aspect of such yards as Sherman’s “Bull
and Mouth,” Chaplin’s “Swan with Two Necks,”
the “Belle Sauvage,” the “Cross Keys,” the
“Golden Cross,” and others was one of repose,
but from unearthly hours in the forenoon until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
nine or ten, or from three o’clock in the afternoon
until nine at night, they were the scenes of bustling
activity. Any reference to old coaching time-bills
will show that the majority of the day stage-coaches
to places distant a hundred miles or more
from London started about 6 a.m. Thus in 1824,
among the coaches from London to Birmingham,
eight are found timed from London between five
and a quarter to eight in the morning; leaving
the rest of the day blank until 3 p.m., when
the earliest of the night coaches set out. The
“Sovereign” went in 1824 from the “Bull,”
Whitechapel, at 5 a.m. Half an hour later went
the “Crown Prince” from the “Belle Sauvage,”
and the “Aurora,” from the “Bull and Mouth”;
followed by the “Courier,” from the “Swan with
Two Necks,” and the “Light Coach” from the
“Cross Keys” and “Golden Cross” at 6. At
6.30 went the “Oxonian Express” from the
“Bull and Mouth”; the “Independent Tally-Ho,”
from the “Golden Cross,” while “Mountain’s
Tally-Ho,” from the “Saracen’s Head,” Snow
Hill, left at 7.45. In the same year the three
early coaches for Bath left London at 5, 5.45,
and 6.15 a.m. These hours, which we should
nowadays regard as extravagantly early, were
necessary if those coaches were to properly serve
the roads they travelled, for even a fast coach,
doing its 9 or 9½ miles an hour, including stoppages,
would not reach Bath or Birmingham before the
day had nearly closed.</p>

<p>These unseasonable hours meant, of course,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
very early rising indeed for would-be passengers,
and not even that hardy generation endured the
infliction without a very great deal of grumbling.
But there was no remedy. It was only a choice
of ills, whether you had to be called at a little
after three o’clock on perhaps a winter’s morning
for a day’s journey, or whether you elected to wait
until the afternoon, and so, travelling through
the night, were deposited at your journey’s end on
the pavements of Bath or Birmingham, or some
other strange place, at the inhospitable hours
between midnight and six a.m.; in which latter
case you would be in that extremely unpleasant
position of wanting to go to bed when the rest
of the world was considering the expediency of
getting out of it.</p>

<p>Some, difficult to arouse in the early morn,
adopted the heroic expedient of sitting up all
night. Others, like Leigh Hunt and James Payn,
taught by long experience, engaged a bedroom
overnight at the inn whence the coach started, so
that they might be on the spot and lie two hours
longer. Even then, as Payn confessed, he often
slept too long, and so, without breakfast, often
carrying his boots in his hand, and in other ways
not completely dressed, would dash into the coach
at the very moment of its moving away.</p>

<p>“We have often wondered,” wrote Dickens,
“how many months’ incessant travelling in a post-chaise
it would take to kill a man; and, wondering
by analogy, we should very much like to know
how many months of constant travelling in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
succession of early coaches an unfortunate mortal
could endure. Breaking a man alive upon the
wheel would be nothing to breaking his rest, his
peace, his heart—everything but his fast—upon
four; and the punishment of Ixion (the only
practical person, by-the-by, who has discovered
the secret of the perpetual motion) would sink
into utter insignificance before the one we have
suggested. If we had been a powerful churchman
in those good times when blood was shed as freely
as water, and men were mowed down like grass
in the sacred cause of religion, we would have lain
by very quietly till we got hold of some especially
obstinate miscreant, who positively refused to be
converted to our faith, and then we would have
booked him for an inside place in a small coach,
which travelled day and night; and, securing the
remainder of the places for stout men with a slight
tendency to coughing and spitting, we would have
started him forth on his last travels—leaving him
mercilessly to all the tortures which the waiters,
landlords, coachmen, guards, boots, chambermaids,
and other familiars on his line of road might think
proper to inflict.</p>

<p>“If,” he continued, “there be one thing in
existence more miserable than another, it most
unquestionably is the being compelled to rise by
candle-light. If you ever doubted the fact, you
are painfully convinced of your error on the
morning of your departure. You left strict orders
overnight to be called at half-past four, and you
have done nothing all night but doze for five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
minutes at a time, and start up suddenly from
a terrific dream of a large church clock with
the small hand running round, with astonishing
rapidity, to every figure on the dial-plate. At
last, completely exhausted, you fall gradually into
a refreshing sleep—your thoughts grow confused—the
stage-coaches, which have been ‘going off’
before your eyes all night, become less and less
distinct, until they go off altogether; one moment
you are driving with all the skill and smartness of
an experienced whip—the next you are exhibiting
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à la</i> Ducrow on the off leader; anon you are
closely muffled up, inside, and have just recognised
in the person of the guard an old school-fellow
whose funeral, even in your dream, you
remember to have attended eighteen years ago.
At last you fall into a state of complete oblivion,
from which you are aroused, as if into a new state
of existence, by a singular illusion. You are
apprenticed to a trunk-maker; how, or why, or
when, or wherefore, you don’t take the trouble
to inquire; but there you are, pasting the lining
in the lid of a portmanteau. Confound that other
apprentice in the back-shop, how he is hammering!—rap,
rap, rap—what an industrious fellow he
must be! you have heard him at work for half
an hour past, and he has been hammering incessantly
the whole time. Rap, rap, rap, again—he’s
talking now—what’s that he said? Five o’clock!
You make a violent exertion, and start up in
bed. The vision is at once dispelled; the trunk-maker’s
shop is your own bedroom, and the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
apprentice your shivering servant, who has been
vainly endeavouring to wake you for the last
quarter of an hour, at the imminent risk of
breaking either his own knuckles or the panels
of the door.</p>

<p>“You proceed to dress yourself with all possible
despatch. The flaring flat candle with the
long snuff gives light enough to show that the
things you want are not where they ought to be,
and you undergo a trifling delay in consequence
of having carefully packed up one of your boots
in your over-anxiety of the preceding night. You
soon complete your toilet, however, for you are not
particular on such an occasion, and you shaved
yesterday evening; so, mounting your Petersham
greatcoat and green travelling shawl, and grasping
your carpet bag in your right hand, you walk
lightly downstairs, lest you should awaken any
of the family, and after pausing in the common
sitting-room for one moment, just to have a cup
of coffee (the said common sitting-room looking
remarkably comfortable, with everything out of its
place, and strewed with the crumbs of last night’s
supper), you undo the chain and bolts of the street-door,
and find yourself fairly in the street.</p>

<p>“A thaw, by all that is miserable! The frost
is completely broken up. You look down the long
perspective of Oxford Street, the gas-lights mournfully
reflected on the wet pavement, and can
discern no speck in the road to encourage the
belief that there is a cab or a coach to be had—the
very coachmen have gone home in despair.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
The cold sleet is drizzling down with that gentle
regularity which betokens a duration of four-and-twenty
hours at least; the damp hangs upon the
housetops and lamp-posts, and clings to you like
an invisible cloak. The water is ‘coming in’ in
every area, the pipes have burst, the water-butts
are running over; the kennels seem to be doing
matches against time, pump-handles descend of
their own accord, horses in market-carts fall down,
and there’s no one to help them up again; policemen
look as if they had been carefully sprinkled
with powdered glass; here and there a milk-woman
trudges slowly along, with a bit of list
round each foot to keep her from slipping; boys
who ‘don’t sleep in the house,’ and are not allowed
much sleep out of it, can’t wake their masters by
thundering at the shop-door, and cry with the cold—the
compound of ice, snow, and water on the
pavement is a couple of inches thick—nobody
ventures to walk fast to keep himself warm, and
nobody could succeed in keeping himself warm if
he did.</p>

<p>“It strikes a quarter past five as you trudge
down Waterloo Place on your way to the “Golden
Cross,” and you discover, for the first time, that
you were called about an hour too early. You
have not time to go back, there is no place open
to go into, and you have, therefore, no resource
but to go forward, which you do, feeling remarkably
satisfied with yourself and everything about
you. You arrive at the office, and look wistfully
up the yard for the Birmingham Highflier, which,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
for aught you can see, may have flown away
altogether, for no preparations appear to be on
foot for the departure of any vehicle in the shape
of a coach. You wander into the booking-office,
which, with the gas-lights and blazing fire, looks
quite comfortable by contrast—that is to say, if
any place <em>can</em> look comfortable at half-past five on
a winter’s morning. There stands the identical
book-keeper in the same position as if he had not
moved since you saw him yesterday. As he
informs you that the coach is up the yard, and
will be brought round in about a quarter of an
hour, you leave your bag and repair to ‘the Tap’—not
with any absurd idea of warming yourself,
because you feel such a result to be utterly hopeless,
but for the purpose of procuring some hot brandy-and-water,
which you do—when the kettle boils!
an event which occurs exactly two minutes and a
half before the time fixed for the starting of the
coach.</p>

<p>“The first stroke of six peals from St. Martin’s
Church steeple just as you take the first sip of the
boiling liquid. You find yourself at the booking-office
in two seconds, and the tap-waiter finds
himself much comforted by your brandy-and-water
in about the same period. The coach is out; the
horses are in, and the guard and two or three
porters are stowing the luggage away, and running
up the steps of the booking-office and down the
steps of the booking-office, with breathless rapidity.
The place, which a few minutes ago was so still
and quiet, is now all bustle; the early vendors of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
the morning papers have arrived, and you are
assailed on all sides with shouts of ‘<i>Times</i>,
gen’l’m’n, <i>Times</i>,’ ‘Here’s <i>Chron—Chron—Chron</i>,’
‘<i>Herald</i>, ma’am,’ ‘Highly interesting murder,
gen’l’m’n,’ ‘Curious case o’ breach o’ promise,
ladies.’ The inside passengers are already in their
dens, and the outsides, with the exception of yourself,
are pacing up and down the pavement to keep
themselves warm; they consist of two young men
with very long hair, to which the sleet has communicated
the appearance of crystallised rats’
tails; one thin young woman, cold and peevish,
one old gentleman ditto ditto, and something in a
cloak and cap, intended to represent a military
officer; every member of the party with a large
stiff shawl over his chin, looking exactly as if he
were playing a set of Pan’s pipes.</p>

<p>“‘Take off the cloths, Bob,’ says the coachman,
who now appears for the first time, in a rough
blue greatcoat, of which the buttons behind are so
far apart that you can’t see them both at the same
time. ‘Now, gen’l’m’n!’ cries the guard, with
the waybill in his hand. ‘Five minutes behind
time already!’ Up jump the passengers—the
two young men smoking like limekilns, and
the old gentleman grumbling audibly. The thin
young woman is got upon the roof by dint of a
great deal of pulling and pushing, and helping
and trouble; and she repays it by expressing her
solemn conviction that she will never be able to
get down again.</p>

<p>“‘All right!’ sings out the guard at last,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
jumping up as the coach starts, and blowing his
horn directly afterwards, in proof of the soundness
of his wind. ‘Let ’em go, Harry; give ’em their
heads!’ cries the coachman—and off we start as
briskly as if the morning were ‘all right,’ as well
as the coach.”</p>

<span class="subhead">HOW THE COACH PASSENGERS FARED: MANNERS
AND CUSTOMS DOWN THE ROAD</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">There</span> is no consensus of opinion to be found
among travellers by coach on the subject of the
joys or sorrows of old-time travel. Everything
depended on the weather, the coach, the other
passengers, and upon the nature of the traveller
himself. Sometimes a coach journey was a
misery; at others it was a joy to look back
upon. Humourists of the early and mid-eighteenth
century found the subject of coach-travelling
very attractive, and returned again
and again to the stock characters of the braggart
and domineering military man among the
passengers, who was really a coward, and the
modest, unassuming young man who always
killed or dispersed the highwaymen while the
captain, who by his own account had fought
at Ramilies with Marlborough, prostrated himself
on the floor and tried to crawl under the
petticoats of the lady passengers or cover himself
with the straw that strewed the floor.
Those humourists could always get a laugh
from such accounts, and sighs of appreciation
from the ladies, who all wished they numbered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
among their acquaintance such proper young
men as Roderick Random, who in Smollett’s
romance performs such prodigies of valour in
the “Exeter Fly” somewhere about the neighbourhood
of Turnham Green.</p>

<p>“When I had taken my seat,” says Roderick,
after an adventure of the kind already hinted at,
“Miss Snapper, who from the coach had seen
everything that had happened, made me a compliment
on my behaviour; and said she was glad
to see me returned without having received
any injury; her mother, too, owned herself
obliged to my resolution; and the lawyer told
me I was entitled by Act of Parliament to a
reward of forty pounds for having apprehended
a highwayman. The soldier”—who had behaved
in the conventional style of poltroonery—“observed,
with a countenance in which impudence
and shame, struggling, produced some disorder,
that if I had not been in such a d——d hurry
to get out of the coach, he would have secured
the rogue effectually without all this bustle and
loss of time, by a scheme which my heat and
precipitation ruined. ‘For my part,’ continued
he, ‘I am always extremely cool on these
occasions.’</p>

<p>“‘So it appeared by your trembling,’ said
the young lady.</p>

<p>“‘Death and the deuce!’ cried he. ‘Your
sex protects you, madam; if any man on earth
durst tell me so much, I’d send him to hell in
an instant.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
“So saying, he fixed his eyes upon me, and
asked if I had seen him tremble. I answered,
without hesitation, ‘Yes.’</p>

<p>“‘Damme, sir,’ said he, ‘d’ye doubt my
courage?’</p>

<p>“I replied, ‘Very much.’</p>

<p>“This declaration quite disconcerted him; he
looked blank, and pronounced in a faltering
voice, ‘Oh! ’tis very well! I shall find a time.’</p>

<p>“I signified my contempt for him by thrusting
my tongue into my cheek, which humbled
him so much that he scarce swore another
oath aloud during the whole journey.”</p>

<p>These soldiers, or pretended soldiers—for it
would not be fair to those who warred under
Marlborough to assume that such cowardly
ruffians were genuine military men—were found
hectoring in every coach in those picturesque
times, threatening to run everyone through the
vitals, and rarely, it is to be feared, meeting
with those modest and self-possessed young
demigods who wore all the lackadaisical airs of
an Apollo superimposed upon the brawn and
biceps of a Hercules, and with those biceps
always at the service of the ladies at precisely
the psychological moment.</p>

<p>Ladies, strange to say, seem at a very early
date to have travelled unaccompanied by friends
or relatives. The way was long, the discomforts
great, and so the politeness and attentions shown
them were proportionately increased. Thoresby,
who in 1714 travelled to London by the York<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
stage with some ladies of sorts, speaks of the
well-established custom of paying for their refreshments
on the road, and mentions, between
Grantham and Stamford, that they were “more
chargeable with wine and brandy than the
former part of the journey, wherein we had
neither; but the next day we gave them leave
to treat themselves.” So the line was drawn
somewhere.</p>

<p>Shergold, who in the coaching era was proprietor
of the “Castle Hotel,” Brighton, and
had every reason to know what life on the road
was like, declared, in a very readable pamphlet
he wrote, that “a woman was a creature to be
looked at, admired, courted, and beloved in a
stage-coach”; but let the rash modern traveller
presume to look admiringly at the lady occupant
of a railway carriage, and it is not at all
unlikely that she will be horribly frightened,
and take the next opportunity of changing into
another compartment.</p>

<p>An amusing tale, declared to be true, has
been told of the possibilities of a coach in the
love-making sort. It was about 1780 that a
young gentleman, anxious to win the good
graces of a lady, and lacking other opportunities,
engaged all the remaining inside seats of the
coach between Glasgow and Edinburgh by which
he knew she would travel. He succeeded so
well in his enterprise that the lady consented
on the journey to be his bride; but candour
compels the admission that the marriage thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
romantically agreed upon turned out a particularly
unhappy one.</p>

<p>The final test of a gentleman in those days
was his behaviour at a stage-coach dinner. It
was, if you consider it, a very severe and unfair
test, for it is allowed that politeness generally
leaves starving people at an early stage; and
the appetites that coach passengers brought with
them into the dining-room of an inn were usually
very keen. An acquaintance of Constable, the
painter, could find no more striking climax to
a list of his virtues than to declare that he was
“a gentleman at a stage-coach dinner.” “Then,”
said his companion, “he must have been a
gentleman indeed!”</p>

<p>What, then, did it mean, this gentlemanly
conduct? It meant, in short, that one who
could fairly lay claim to it must take some lady
of the party into his care, escort her from the
coach into the inn, see to it that she was provided
with dinner, and pay her reckoning, he
must not first attempt to satisfy his own hunger,
although perhaps he was up at five o’clock in
the morning, and had only taken a hurried coach-breakfast
at the first stage out.</p>

<p>The gentleman who fulfilled the canons of this
time could rarely hope to get any dinner for
himself. On the later coaches, time was so
strictly kept that the coachmen were off to the
minute; and the landlords, who, of course, knew
that, were generally suspected of delaying the
appearance of the food so long that not one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
the party could have time to do justice to it.
Our gentleman, therefore, often had the mortification
of paying both for the lady’s dinner
and for his own, of which he had not tasted a
mouthful. He returned to the coach as hungry
as he had left it, and kept his gentility as warm
as it was possible to do on an empty stomach. A
very little of this was sufficient to wear the nap
off the politeness of a Chesterfield, and it must
not infrequently have happened that the person
who had been all courtliness at dinner became
selfishness incarnate at tea.</p>

<p>Those who did not come up to the high
standard that Constable attained—and they were
in the majority—hurried out of the coach without
the slightest consideration for any one else, and
flinging themselves into the inn, roared out for
“dinner, d——d quick”; or—older travellers
and more wary—filled their spirit flasks at the
bar, and made sure of having a meal of sorts by
demanding cold ham or beef, or any of those
dishes which the hostelries of that time possessed
in abundance.</p>

<p>Many writers have attempted to describe those
coach-dinners, and one endeavoured to vividly
picture them by declaring that they reminded
him more of hounds feeding at a trough than
human beings; but none have equalled the
anonymous account quoted here.</p>

<p>“First of all, you had, in winter, to be called
before daylight; then you had to proceed in a
rattling hackney-coach (your teeth rattling to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
match with the cold) to the office from which the
‘Wonder,’ ‘Telegraph,’ ‘Regulator,’ ‘Highflyer,’
or ‘Independent’ started; then you were hurried
over your meals, as the following account will
<span class="locked">show:—</span></p>

<p>“‘Twenty minutes allowed here, gentlemen,
for dinner,’ exclaims the coachman, as we drive
up to the ‘Bull’ at Smallborough.</p>

<p>“What a scene of confusion ensued! Bells
rang, ostlers halloed, waiters ran, or rather broke
into that shambling shuffle whose secret seems
to be known only to those who ‘stand and wait’—at
least, no other creature practises it.</p>

<p>“‘Please to alight, ladies and gentlemen,’
exclaims the landlord, addressing the four insides;
while the ostler, bringing a somewhat crazy ladder,
makes a similar request to the eleven outsides.</p>

<p>“The day has been a miserable specimen:
incessant rain, with a biting easterly wind, giving
an inappropriately jocose gentleman the opportunity
of offering facetious remarks upon ‘heavy
wet,’ and ‘cold without.’ You enter the best
parlour of the inn, anticipating a warm welcome
and a share in those creature comforts looked
forward to in such circumstances by all. But
here the legal axiom, that ‘possession is nine
points of the law,’ is realised to your horror and
dismay in a sight of the first-comers on an earlier
coach occupying every seat near the fire; while
a tablecloth covered with fragments, and a disarray
of empty glasses tell a tale of another
dinner having recently been ‘polished off.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
“‘Waiter, waiter!’ shriek half a dozen voices
in as many keys, and in accents ranging from
the imperious to the imploring. Enters then a
slipshod, soiled being, with watery eyes and apologetic
mien. ‘Here, you, where’s the dinner?’
chorus the starving, half-drenched passengers.</p>

<p>“‘Dinner?’—scratching his head; ’er—well—er:
beg pardon, gents, but the “Independent”
was rather late like to-day, and the “Highflyer,”
she were down early, and—er——’ Well, the gist
of all these apologetics was that the company had
to wait while the next joint was being dished up.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile the ‘Independents’ absorbing all
the fire are bustled off by a portly man in a
low-crowned hat and a huge caped box-coat, or
‘upper Benjamin,’ as it used to be called.
‘Gentlemen,’ he roars, ‘time’s up!’ With great
to-do of cloaking, shawling, greatcoating, and
paying, they are outside, and we, in the twinkling
of an eye, in their fireside seats, listening to the
curses levelled at the ostler by the outsides for
letting the seats get wet. With a precautionary
‘Sit tight,’ they lurch violently off, and we are
left anxiously awaiting the arrival of that dinner.</p>

<p>“At last it comes: a procession of three—the
landlady, parlourmaid, and waiter—bearing dishes
with tin covers. These battered relics removed,
a coarse fat leg of mutton, roasted to a cinder,
is unveiled, together with a huge joint of boiled
beef, very much underdone; potatoes, hot without
and hard within, and some gritty cabbage.</p>

<p>“‘Slice of mutton for a lady,’ says the waiter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
approaching a stout gentleman in the act of
helping himself to that part of the joint so highly
prized by epicures, called the ‘Pope’s eye.’ The
direction of the knife is instantly changed, and
the lady’s plate filled with a somewhat less desirable
ration. ‘Please, sir, a little fat,’ continues
the assiduous waiter, ‘and a little gravy,’ he adds,
anxious to earn a tip from the old stager of the
male sex, who thus invariably forwarded his
demands, as coming from a lady. Numerous
other applications are made to the carver, who,
disgusted with his place, helps himself to his
coveted delicacy, and requests the waiter, with
emphasis, to attend to the other passengers
himself.</p>

<p>“Time flies fast, and especially time devoted
to pleasure, and none of the party are aware
how fast the glass has run, until the entrance of
the coachman, informing all concerned that the
coach is ready.</p>

<p>“Up starts the stout gentleman. ‘Coachman,
the time can’t be up; I’ve not eaten a morsel.’</p>

<p>“‘Full twenty minutes, sir,’ replies that Jehu.</p>

<p>“‘Abominable,’ continues the first speaker.</p>

<p>“‘Who riseth from a feast with that keen
appetite that he sits down?’ quotes a stage-struck
attorney’s clerk.</p>

<p>“‘I have,’ mutters the Daniel Lambert of the
party; ‘and if Shakespeare wrote that—well,
coach-dinners were not known in his time.’</p>

<p>“Now we do as we saw the ‘Independents’
do before us, and fee the coachman, scramble for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
greatcoats, cloaks, shawls and umbrellas, in
addition to ringing for the waiters to bring that
brandy-and-water ordered ten minutes before, but
not yet forthcoming.</p>

<p>“Half-crowns and shillings are tendered in
payment to the waiter, who of course has no
change: what waiter ever had, when you were in
a hurry? It is a mere additional annoyance
that the stage-struck youth finds this an opportunity
of quoting from <i>Pizarro</i>, ‘We want
no change, and, least of all, such change as
you would give us,’ concluding with the lines
of one of Haynes Bayley’s popular <span class="locked">ballads:—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And were I in a foreign land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You’d find no change in me.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>“Now, at the ultimate moment, the waiter
appears with a tray containing ‘one cold, without,’
‘four hots, with,’ ‘two hots, sugar and no fruit,’
and ‘three with the chill off’—the ‘with’ and
‘without’ referring to sugar, the ‘no fruit’
applying to lemon. Fortunate now are the
owners of cold beverages, for none but a fire-eater
could swallow the scalding potations that
are now left as perquisites to the waiter. Amid
the babel of departure may be distinguished,
‘Please remember the waiter, sir!’ ‘Didn’t
take for your dinner, sir.’ ‘Glass of brandy,
ma’am.’ ‘A basin of soup and a pint of ale gone
away without paying!’ ‘Chambermaid, ma’am.’
‘Ostler, sir! I got you some nice dry straw.’</p>

<p>“Away, away. ‘Now, gentlemen, sit fast.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
Let ’em go, Jem—I’ve got ’em!’ and off goes
the ‘Highflyer.’”</p>

<p>Here is another such scene, observed with
another pair of eyes, or imagined by another
<span class="locked">brain:—</span></p>

<p>“‘Put the joints opposite the women,’ says
the landlord to the waiter taking in the dinner;
‘they’re slow carvers.’</p>

<p>“Meanwhile, passengers are busy, taking off
coats, one, two and three in succession (those
were the days of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bonâ-fide</i> ‘great-coats,’ nowadays
become lessened, and merely overcoats).
Chins appear out of their many wrappages of
silk, and fur caps are bundled into pockets. Inside
passengers eye outsiders with suspicion, while
a deaf gentleman who has left his trumpet in the
coach meets an acquaintance whom he has not
seen for seven years, and in consequence of not
having that instrument with him can only shake
hands and grimace in return to the speaker’s
greetings:</p>

<p>“‘You find it very warm inside, I should
think, sir, don’t you?’ says the acquaintance.</p>

<p>“‘Thank ye, my good friend; I am rather deaf,
but I suppose you are inquiring after my wife and
daughters: they are quite well, thank you.’</p>

<p>“‘Where will you sit at dinner?’ rejoins the
acquaintance.</p>

<p>“‘It is two years since I was there,’ replies he.</p>

<p>“‘No: where will you sit, sir? I said.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh! John: he is still in Jamaica with his
regiment.’...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
“‘Come, waiter, d—n it all, why was not the
dinner on the table when we arrived?’ demands
a superfine inside passenger. ‘This is always
the way with your confounded coach-dinners.
And what have you got under there,—goose, eh?’</p>

<p>“‘No; pork, sir.’</p>

<p>“‘What is under that cover?’</p>

<p>“‘Pork too, sir.”</p>

<p>“‘Great heavens! pork again! the country is
deluged with pork: who the devil do you think
can dine off pork?’</p>

<p>“‘A couple of ducks coming, sir,’ says the
waiter.</p>

<p>“‘Confound your ducks! What with your
pork and ducks, you’ll make the whole inside
of the coach reek with onions and vulgarity.’</p>

<p>“‘There’s a cold collation on the side-table,
sir, if you prefer cold meat.’</p>

<p>“‘Hang your cold collation! have you got any
real Devonshire cider in the house?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, sir; some very excellent.’</p>

<p>“‘Then bring me a bottle, and a toothpick.’</p>

<p>“‘Now, look here, waiter,’ says one of the
diners, ‘there are the horses out already, and
we have not half done yet: blow me if I go
before the half-hour’s up.’</p>

<p>“‘Take any cheese, sir?’ asks the waiter.</p>

<p>“‘No, to be sure, not yet; have you no
tarts?’</p>

<p>“‘Why, none, I am afraid, that we can recommend,
sir; but there’s some very nice cold plum-pudding
you can have.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
“Enter coachman: ‘I leaves you here, if you
please, sir.’</p>

<p>“‘Just as you please; I have no objection,’
says a satirical passenger.</p>

<p>“‘Please to remember the coachman—driven
you forty-five miles.’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, but you will recollect you were very
impertinent about my wife’s bandbox;—there’s a
shilling, between us, for you.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh! sir, I’m sure I didn’t mean no unperliteness—I
hopes you von’t think nothink about it;
it were wery aggravising that the box was forgot,
but I hopes you’ll give me a trifle more—forty-five
miles.’</p>

<p>“‘No, no more—so be off.’...</p>

<p>“‘Please to remember the coachman, ma’am—forty-five
miles. Leave you here, sir, if
you please—go no further, sir—forty-five miles,
ma’am.’...</p>

<p>“‘Now, ladies and gentlemen, the coach is
quite ready: time’s up,’ says the guard, entering
the room....</p>

<p>“‘What’s dinner, waiter?’</p>

<p>“‘Two-and-three, and eighteenpence—one-and-eightpence—is
three-and-eleven, sir,’ says the
cunning waiter, whose artful arithmetic is decidedly
not ‘according to Cocker.’ ‘Yours is
three-and-sixpence, ma’am—two glasses brandy
and water. Yours is four shillings, sir—a bottle
of real Devonshire cider, sir.’...</p>

<p>“‘Now, sir, coach is ready—time up; can’t
wait,’ roars out the guard. ‘Here, Joe, set the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
ladder for the lady’; and the passengers are
hurried into their places.”</p>

<p>Not so hurried was that gentleman who on
one of these quick-change and pantomime-rally
occasions remained calmly drinking his tea while
his fellow-passengers were jostling each other in
their anxiety to regain their seats.</p>

<p>“You’ll miss the coach, sir!” shouted the
landlord in his ear, under the impression that he
was deaf and had not heard the stampeding feet.</p>

<p>“I want a spoon to stir my tea,” said this last-remaining
guest: “why didn’t we have any?”</p>

<p>The landlord glanced hurriedly round—not one
spoon of all those that had been on the table
remained. He rushed out to the coach to find
who among the passengers had stolen them; and
by the time he had delayed the coach and insulted
everyone, the last passenger, having finished his
breakfast at leisure, came out with the information
that they had been found in the teapot,
where, as will by now have been suspected, he
had himself placed them.</p>

<p>There is no generalising on the subject of
coach-breakfasts or dinners. Some inns were
famous for good fare, others were notorious for
bad provisioning and worse service; and all were
liable to change from good to ill, or the reverse,
according to how they changed hands from time
to time. Sidney Smith, who was under no
illusions, and lived well into the railway age, did
not lament the days when he travelled post from
Combe Florey to London—“living for three days<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
on veal-cutlets and waiters”; but, on the other
hand, travellers equally familiar with the roads
were heard lamenting the good and varied fare
they had been used to find, and sought in vain in
later days. Lord William Lennox wrote regretfully
of the “plain and perfect” English dinners
down the road, generally consisting, he said, of
mutton-broth, rich in meat and herbs, fresh-water
fish in every form, eels—stewed, fried, boiled,
baked, spitchcocked, and water-souché; salmon,
the purest butter, green gooseberries, the earliest
cucumbers, saddle of Southdown mutton, kept to
a moment and done to a turn, mutton chops,
hot and hot, Irish stews, rump-steaks tender and
juicy, chicken and ham, plum-pudding, fruit-tarts,
and trifle and gooseberry-fool.</p>

<p>Then the produce of the grape! No thin,
washy claret, at 18<i>s.</i> a dozen, no fiery port, one
day in bottle, no sherry at 25<i>s.</i> the cask; but
fine, sound vintages, fit for any private cellar.</p>

<p>Other travellers tell less roseate tales. Often
they had the sole choice between ham and eggs,
ill cooked, and nothing at all; or, if the choice
was there, the mutton was half-done and stringy,
the chops greasy and cold, and the rump-steaks
tough and dry, with everything else in accordance.
If we like to take Thomas Hughes, in
<i>Tom Brown</i>, as an authority, however, the breakfasts
were really noble meals; for Tom, going to
Rugby, is represented at a table spread with the
whitest of cloths, and rich in cold pigeon-pie, a
Yorkshire ham, a round of cold boiled beef, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
a loaf of household bread. On these the guests
made a beginning, but the waiter entered “in an
instant” (paragon of waiters!) with kidneys, steak,
rashers of bacon, poached eggs, and buttered toast
and muffins. Tom fell-to with a will, and put
away kidneys and pigeon-pie and coffee until his
little skin was as tight as a drum—little pig!</p>

<p>It is a coach-breakfast that is so well pictured
by James Pollard in the accompanying illustration.
The company, with an indescribable air of
having been up all night, are just finishing their
meal, and the polite gentleman in the ample overcoat
is trying to induce the two ladies under his
charge to take a little more. It is quite evident
that this has been a more leisured affair than
usual, for the yawning travellers by the fireplace
have finished their meal long ago, and a stout
person is being shaved by a barber in knee-breeches,
with legs of a distinctly Lowther-Arcadian
type, suggestive of bran and sawdust
instead of bone and muscle. The coachman,
appearing hat in hand and touching his forehead,
has come to the end of his stage: he “goes no
further, gents,” and is here to claim his dues.
Meanwhile, the guard outside is lustily blowing
his horn, and the empty coach is seen waiting.</p>

<p>The scene, in fact, here pictured is the last halt
on a long journey; an opportunity seized by the
passengers, not only for a meal, but for a shave
and a general brush-up preparatory to alighting at
their destination. Such scenes were the commonplace
incidents to be observed at Highgate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
Barnet, Hounslow, and other stages near London
in the coaching age.</p>

<p>Here at least—for there are twelve passengers
present—the insides and the outsides have foregathered,
and for once the gulf socially dividing
them has been bridged. This generally impassable
gulf was more marked in the case of the mails
than in that of the stage-coaches. The very
superior and exclusive travellers who went in
their own chariots or by post-chaise resorted to
well-known hotels and posting-houses on the
roads, whose chaste halls were never profaned by
coaches. Even the superior persons who travelled
inside the mails could not hope to win to those
expensive and select abiding-places; but they
formed a caste by themselves, who never willingly
sat at meat with the outsides. De Quincey, who
often travelled outside, experienced something of
this contempt, and the recollection seems to have
lent eloquence to his remarks on the subject. It
was, he tells us, “The fixed assumption of the four
inside people that they, the illustrious quaternion,
constituted a porcelain variety of the human race,
whose dignity would have been compromised by
exchanging one word of civility with the three
miserable delf-ware outsides. Even to have
kicked an outsider might have been held to attaint
the foot concerned in that operation, so that
perhaps it would have required an Act of Parliament
to restore its purity of blood. What words,
then, could express the horror and the sense of
treason in that case, which <em>had</em> happened, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
all three outsides (the trinity of Pariahs) made a
vain attempt to sit down at the same breakfast-table
or dinner-table with the consecrated four?
I myself witnessed such an attempt; and on that
occasion a benevolent old gentleman endeavoured
to soothe his three holy associates by suggesting
that if the outsides were indicted for this criminal
attempt at the next assizes, the court would regard
it as a case of lunacy or delirium tremens rather
than that of treason. England owes much of her
grandeur to the depth of the aristocratic element
in her social composition when pulling against
her own strong democracy. I am not the man
to laugh at it. But sometimes, undoubtedly, it
expressed itself in comic shapes. The course taken
with the infatuated outsiders, in the particular
attempt which I have noticed, was that the waiter,
beckoning them away from the privileged <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salle-à-manger</i>,
sang out, ‘This way, my good men,’ and then
enticed these good men away to the kitchen. But
that plan had not always answered. Sometimes,
though rarely, cases occurred where the intruders,
being stronger than usual, or more vicious than
usual, resolutely refused to budge, and so far
carried their point as to have a separate table
arranged for themselves in a corner of the general
room. Yet, if an Indian screen could be found
ample enough to plant them out from the very
eyes of the high table or dais, it then became
possible to assume as a fiction of law that the
three delf fellows after all were not present. They
could be ignored by the porcelain men, under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
maxim that objects not appearing and not existing
are governed by the same logical construction.”</p>

<p>Humour had a splendid field in coaching, and
the literature of the road is gemmed with twice
a hundred good stories and mirth-provoking scenes.
Few things seem to have been more productive of
funny stories than the undue tendency to fatness
on the part of a passenger. There is, for example,
the tale of the stupid servant who, having to book
two seats inside a coach for his master, a man
of prodigious bulk, to whom one seat would be
useless, returned from the booking-office with the
news that he had secured the only two places to
be had—one inside and one out.</p>

<p>This bears comparison with that other story
of the stout man’s revenge. He, too, was
accustomed to book two seats. On one occasion
this amiable eccentricity of his was observed
overnight by two waggish fellows who thought
they would play a trick on the fat man. They
accordingly booked seats also, and took care to
be seated in them before the man of much
avoirdupois came. They sat facing one another,
one back and the other in front, so that he
had indeed two seats, but not, as they necessarily
should have been, together. He asked them very
politely to change their positions, but they refused,
although he explained that he had booked two
seats, and his reason for doing so. There the
seats were, they said.</p>

<p>But the outraged man of flesh determined to
be revenged, and, looking round at the next stage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
where the coach stopped, spied a chimney-sweep,
he beckoned.</p>

<p>“Chimley, yer honour?” queried Chummy.</p>

<p>“No: come here. Have you any objection
to a ride this morning? I’ll pay you for a day’s
work, and your fare back again.”</p>

<p>“All right, yer honour; I’ll just run home and
clean myself.”</p>

<p>“No, no! come as you are, and when in the
coach give yourself a good shake every now and
then, to make the soot fly.”</p>

<p>They got in, Chummy acting his part very well,
and greatly to the annoyance and discomfort of
the wags, who, however, said nothing. But when
the coach stopped at the next change, and for
breakfast, they asked the man who had been their
butt, and was now their tormentor, how far he
was going to take the sweep, as he was not a very
desirable companion.</p>

<p>He replied: “I took two seats so that, although
corpulent, I should annoy no one. You prevented
me occupying them, therefore I filled the remaining
seat with Chummy, and he goes as far as
the end of my journey. But I will dismiss him
if you will agree to what I propose. When I
engaged him, I agreed to pay him for his time,
and to pay his fare home, with all other expenses
incurred. He is now at breakfast. If you agree
to pay him, he goes no farther; if not, he proceeds.”</p>

<p>Having listened to this ultimatum, and being
completely discomfited, they accepted these terms,
and the sweep was dismissed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
Among the most laughable of old-time skits
on coaching miseries is the following breathless
account, in the style of the immortal Jingle. Its
humour is somewhat broad, and indeed all coaching
humour was of the smoking-room rather than
of the drawing-room <span class="locked">order:—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center larger">“<span class="smcap">Stage-Coach Adventures.</span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Inside.</span>—Crammed full of passengers—three
fat fusty old men—a young mother and sick
child—a cross old maid—a poll parrot—a bag of
red herrings—double-barrelled gun (which you
are afraid is loaded)—and a snarling lapdog, in
addition to yourself. Awake out of a sound nap
with the cramp in one leg and the other in a
lady’s bandbox—pay the damage (four or five
shillings) for gallantry’s sake—getting out in the
dark at the half-way house, in the hurry stepping
into the return coach and finding yourself next
morning at the very spot you had started from the
evening before—not a breath of air—asthmatic
old woman and child with the measles—window
closed in consequence—unpleasant smell—shoes
filled with warm water—look up and find it’s the
child—obliged to bear it—no appeal—shut your
eyes and scold the dog—pretend sleep and pinch
the child—mistake—pinch the dog and get bit—execrate
the child in return—black looks—no
gentleman—pay the coachman and drop a piece
of gold in the straw—not to be found—fell
through a crevice—coachman says ‘He’ll find it’—can’t—get
out yourself—gone—picked up by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
ostler—no time for blowing up—coach off for
next stage—lose your money—get in—lose your

your temper—turn sulky—and turned over in
a horse pond.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Outside.</span>—Your eye cut out by the lash of
a clumsy coachman’s whip—hat blown off into a
pond by a sudden gust of wind—seated between
two apprehended murderers and a noted sheep-stealer

drunken fellow half-asleep falls off the coach—and
in attempting to save himself drags you along
with him into the mud—musical guard, and driver
horn mad—turned over—one leg under a bale
of cotton, the other under the coach—hands in
breeches pockets—head in hamper of wine—lots of
broken bottles <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">versus</i> broken heads—cut and run—send
for surgeon—wounds dressed, lotion and
lint, four dollars—take post-chaise—get home—lie
down—and laid up.”</p></blockquote>

<p>A “humorous” story is told of a coach coming
into Dover at night, and the coachman, “feather-edging”
a corner, running into a lamp-post.
It was the period just after Waterloo. A little
French count, who occupied the box-seat, was
thrown off, and, falling on his side, had three
ribs fractured. The coachman pulled up and
asked a passing sailor to pick up the unhappy
passenger. The half-drunken tar, seeing a heap
of limp clothes on the pavement, said, “There’s
no gemman here—on’y a lot of coats.” At that
moment the Count groaned, “Oh! by gar! I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
brake tree rib.” “Damn your eyes!” roared the
sailor, “you’re a Frenchman, are you? Lie there
and be damned,” and so went on his way.</p>

<p>I think the brutality of this tale is even
more noticeable than its humour, but it is
distinctly redolent of the age when people only
laughed on seeing others placed in a painful
or uncomfortable position. When no one was
hurt there was no humour, according to the
notions of that time—a time when to crush a
man’s hat over his eyes was exquisitely funny,
and for half a dozen lusty Toms and Jerrys
to overturn a decrepit old watchman was a
screaming farce. It is, by the way, significant
that that was the era when screaming farces held
the theatrical stage, and the rough-and-tumble
of the harlequinade was at its zenith. The
practical joker was then prominent, and the
more “practical” (<i>i.e.</i> the more wantonly cruel
and injurious) the joke the more it was applauded.
If the victim ever thought of resenting a witticism
of this kind, he was, in the cant of that period,
“no sportsman,” and behind that formula the
blackguard jokers screened themselves. If they
had not very carefully, for their own protection,
erected that obligation to “take a thing in good
part” which stayed the heavy hand of revenge,
it is quite likely that some of these humourists
would have been very severely mauled. The
amazing thing is that the victims agreed to that
convention, and allowed themselves to be harassed
with impunity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
Practical joking affected every class. One
of the old borough members of Parliament—Francis
Fane, who began his long Parliamentary
career in 1790—was a practical joker of the
most desolating kind. Travelling by coach to
London along the Exeter Road on one occasion,
he saw, from his seat inside, the coat-tails of
one of the outside passengers—a barber, of
Dorchester—hanging down. This gave him the
pleasing notion of cutting open the pocket and
extracting its contents, which happened to be
a bulky parcel of banknotes the unfortunate
shaver had had given in his charge. The extraordinary
cruelty of the practical jokers who made
existence a burden to their victims a hundred
years ago promised Fane to gloat over the
barber’s terror when he found the notes gone,
and only to restore them when his enjoyment
could be carried no farther. As some amends,
he entertained his victim at the White Horse
Cellar on the eve of the barber’s return
to Dorchester; but his practical joking was
not yet complete, for, taking excellent care
that his victim should be fully charged with
liquor, he hustled him into the night coach for
quite another Dorchester—Dorchester, Oxfordshire—where
he was duly set down the following
morning.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">Some</span> detailed notice of the Palmer family will have
interest here. Mischance long ago destroyed many
genealogical documents relating to John Palmer’s
ancestors, but family tradition still points to the
“John Palmere” who, in 1384, represented Bath in
Parliament, as a distinguished forbear. Of ancient
and honourable origin, the matrimonial alliances of
the Palmers are found among the old county families
of Somerset and Wilts. The postal reformer’s mother
was one of the Longs, to this day seated in the latter
county. She and her husband, John Palmer the elder,
lie at Weston, two miles from Bath, and in the village
church their memorial tablets may yet be seen.</p>

<p>A tradition tells how the reformer himself might
have become a Long, had he desired. His kinsman,
Walter Long, who died unmarried at the age of ninety-five,
proposed to make him heir to extensive estates
in Wilts, on condition that he assumed the name;
but, with the pardonable arrogance of one who owned
an ancient and honourable ancestry, Palmer declined,
and satisfied his pride even though he relinquished a
rent-roll.</p>

<p>He received his education at Colerne, Wilts, and at
Marlborough Grammar School. Of his three sons, John
proceeded to Cambridge and took holy orders; Charles
and Edmund, educated at Eton, went respectively into
the Army and Navy. It is curious to note how strong
has been the military tradition in the family. Charles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
became Colonel of the 10th (Prince of Wales’s) Hussars,
following upon the scandal which discredited the
former Colonel of that regiment, many of whose officers,
charged with cowardice before the enemy in the
Peninsula, were transferred to other regiments, and
became known as the “Elegant Extracts.” Their
places were filled by officers from other sources, and
the 10th Hussars thereupon acquired the title of
“Prince’s Mixture.” Colonel Palmer subsequently rose
to the rank of general officer.</p>

<p>Edmund was that distinguished captain in the Navy
who, when in command of H.M.S. <i>Hebrus</i> in 1814, captured
the French frigate, <i>L’Etoile</i>, the last of the
enemy’s ships to be taken at the end of the long war.
His son, Colonel Edmund Palmer, R.A., has himself
carried on the tradition, and given sons of his own to
the service of his country. His son Edmund fell to the
bullet of an Afghan hillman, after he had captured a
tower in one of the passes of that distant country
whose sun-baked rocks have been stained with the
blood of many a gallant Englishman. John Jervis
Palmer, his brother, captain in the Egyptian Army,
died of pneumonia at the frontier post of Wady Halfa,
looking out across the parching sands of the Soudan.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
